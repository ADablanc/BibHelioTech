Abstract The delayed ionospheric response is analyzed for two well-defined 27-day solar rotation
periods in the year 2019 with solar radio flux index F10.7 and Global-scale Observations of the Limb and
Disk (GOLD) data, like solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux proxy, O/N, column density ratio and peak
electron density, as well as International Global Navigation Satellite System Service rapid high-rate total
electron content (TEC) map data. Although the correlation between GOLD solar EUV flux proxy and
TEC is similar to the correlation between F10.7 and TEC, it is shown that the estimated delays based on
GOLD data are in much better agreement with recent studies using EUV measurements compared to the
delays based on F10.7 data. The GOLD peak electron density correlates well with TEC and allows insight
to a local time interval when the ionosphere is not controlled by solar activity changes (17:00 LT to 21:00
LT). The present study investigates the impact of the solar activity (F10.7, GOLD EUV flux proxy) and
O/N, column density ratio on the ionospheric delay for two representative solar rotation periods. The
capabilities of GOLD data for future research on the ionospheric response to the 27-day solar rotation
period are demonstrated and discussed. These results are crucial information for precise ionospheric
models and forecasts.

1. Introduction

The absorption of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation in the upper atmosphere defines the ionospheric plasma by ionization and heating but also controls the neutral parts of the thermosphere (Kelley, 2009).
The photoionization of O, O2, and N2, the photodissociation of O2, and the dissociative photoionization of
N, are the major processes during the absorption. These processes control the ionospheric state and, thus,
the ionospheric response to different variations of the solar activity (Kelley, 2009). The 27-day solar rotation
period is a significant variation of the solar activity that is known to impact the ionospheric plasma (Forbes
et al., 2000; Kane et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2012; Min et al., 2009; Oinats et al., 2008; Rich, 2003; Rishbeth &
Mendillo, 2001). The ionospheric response to these variations is not immediate and a delay of a few hours
up to days occurs (Afraimovich et al., 2008; Jakowski et al., 1991, 2002; Lee et al., 2012; Min et al., 2009;
Oinats et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2018; Schmolter et al., 2018, 2020; Titheridge, 1973; Zhang & Holt, 2008).
Spatial and temporal features of this delayed ionospheric response are of actual scientific interest and are
characterized in recent studies (Ren et al., 2018, 2019, 2020; SchmOlter et al., 2020) to improve our understanding of physical and chemical processes causing the delay (Ren et al., 2018; Schmolter et al., 2020;
Vaishnav et al., 2019).

The delayed ionospheric response to the 27-day solar rotation period of the solar activity is explained by two
major absorption processes of the upper atmosphere. The photodissociation of O, impacts the density of O
and O, in the ionospheric F region and can cause the accumulation of O. This accumulation is supposed
to result in a change of the ionospheric state causing a delayed response to the change of solar activity
(Jakowski et al., 1991, 2002; Titheridge, 1973). The O and N, densities and more specifically their ratio
define the ion production and loss of the ionospheric plasma (Rishbeth, 1998). While the ion production
due to O is almost immediate, the loss due to N, is not (Ren et al., 2018). Therefore, solar activity variations
cannot cause corresponding changes immediately in the ionospheric plasma at all times (Ren et al., 2018;
Schm6lter et al., 2020).

Analyzing the delayed ionospheric response based on solar EUV measurements at high temporal resolution (<1 h) allows to define spatial and temporal variations in detail (Schmdlter et al., 2020), but long-term

studies are difficult due to frequent or big data gaps (Schmdlter et al., 2018, 2020). Therefore, the combined
analysis of several ionospheric and solar parameters is also important to improve the current understanding
of the delay.

The recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission Global-scale Observations of
the Limb and Disk (GOLD) provides a set of new data products including a solar EUV flux proxy, the O/
N, column density ratio and the peak electron density. This combination of measurements is of interest for
the analysis of the ionospheric response time to the 27-day solar rotation period. This study presents first
results of such an analysis and compares the findings to solar and ionospheric parameters, that have been
commonly used in preceding studies. The potential of GOLD data to characterize the delayed ionospheric
response is discussed based on these results.

2. Data

This study analyses different solar proxies and ionospheric parameters in the time period from January 2019
until December 2019. This period is part of the descending phase of the 24th solar cycle, which is defined by
low solar and geomagnetic activity (Pesnell, 2016; Solomon et al., 2010). Two 27-day solar rotation periods
from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019 are analyzed in more detail.

2.1. Solar Radio Flux Index F10.7

The solar radio flux at a wavelength of 10.7 cm (F10.7) is a well-established solar activity index, which is
used in several studies and ionospheric modeling approaches to indicate the solar activity level in general
or as a proxy for the solar radiation at wavelengths that are difficult to measure (Tapping, 2013). F10.7
measures the total emission of the solar disk over a period of 1 h centered on the selected epoch (17:00,
20:00, 23:00 UT) and represents the full solar spectrum (Tapping, 2013; Tapping & Charrois, 1994). The
ionospheric response to solar activity changes and its delay has been investigated in several studies based
on F10.7 (Afraimovich et al., 2008; Jakowski et al, 1991, 2002; Lee et al., 2012; Min et al., 2009; Oinats
et al., 2008;Titheridge, 1973; Zhang & Holt, 2008). F10.7 data are obtained from the NASA/GSFC's OMNI
data set through the OMNIWeb interface (NASA, 2020).

2.2. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory

The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Solar EUV Monitor (SEM) measures the solar EUV radiation continuously in two bands from 26 to 34 nm and from 0.1 to 50 nm (Judge et al., 1998; Zanna
et al., 2015). This study uses the first order band which contains one of the strongest solar EUV emission
lines (He II at 30.4 nm) and which impacts significantly the ionospheric state (Zanna et al., 2015). SEM data
are obtained from the University of Southern California (USC) Space Sciences Center (NASA, 2020).

2.3. Global-Scale Observations of the Limb and Disk

GOLD measures different features of Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere allowing comprehensive studies of Earth's space environment and the upper atmosphere (Eastes et al., 2020). GOLD is an instrument
retrieving measurements based on different scans of the sunlit disk, night disk, and limb (Eastes et al., 2017,
2020). The dayside disk measurements are used to derive neutral temperature, O/N, column density ratio
and solar EUV flux proxy. The peak electron density is derived from the nightside disk measurements and
the O, density profile is derived from stellar occultation measurements (NASA, 2020). The solar EUV flux
proxy, the O/N, column density ratio and the peak electron density are of interest for this study on the ionospheric response to solar activity changes.

The satellite is in a geostationary orbit at 47.5°W and measures the full spectrum from 134 to 162 nm (Eastes
et al., 2017) producing disk images from +70° in latitude and longitude (at nadir) as well as limb measurements up to 600 km tangent altitude with different measurements modes (Eastes et al., 2017, 2020). The
full disk images describing temperature and composition of the thermosphere at approximately 160 km
are retrieved by combining scans of the north and south latitudes. Each scan of the full disk (30 min) ends

with a limb scan or an occultation if a bright star transits the limb (Eastes et al., 2020). The disk images
of the thermospheric temperature at 60 min cadence have a precision of +55 K and the disk images of
the O/N, column density ratio at 30 min cadence have a precision of 10%. Both disk images are measured
at 250 x 250 km” spatial resolution (Eastes et al., 2020). The peak electron density measurements of the
equatorial arcs have a latitude resolution of 2° and precision of 10% (Eastes et al., 2020). The O, column
density measurements at vertical resolution of 10 km have a precision of 10% above 150 km from stellar
occultations (Eastes et al., 2020).

The solar EUV flux proxy Qguy describes the integrated solar irradiance below 45 nm and is derived from
the far ultraviolet (FUV) measurements using a look-up-table. The O J 135.6 nm brightness, solar zenith
angle and O/N, column density ratio are applied in this approach (NASA, 2020) according to algorithms
by Strickland et al. (1995), Evans et al. (1995) and Strickland (2004). The sampling rate of Qeuy is approximately 5 s (NASA, 2020).

The O/N, column density ratio of the thermospheric species O and N; is derived from the dayside measurements. The applied algorithms for this process were developed for data processing with Global Ultraviolet
Imager (GUVI) and Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager, but take advantage of the full spectrum measured by GOLD to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (NASA, 2020). The approach is implemented
according to algorithms by Strickland et al. (1995), Christensen (2003) and Strickland (2004).

GOLD performs scans of the nightside disk each day from 17:00 LT to 21:00 LT (corresponding to 47.5°W)
and the peak electron density Nyx is directly derived from the O J 135.6 nm night glow emission measurements (NASA, 2020). This algorithm is based on the following assumptions: the ion-ion mutual neutralization is neglected, multiple scattering is neglected, the electron and O* densities are identical and the
electron density profile is a Chapman layer profile (NASA, 2020).

The GOLD level 2 data products (solar EUV flux proxy Qguy, O/N2 column density ratio and peak electron
density Nyax) are provided by NASA through the GOLD Science Data Center (NASA, 2020).

2.4. Total Electron Content Maps

The International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Service (IGS) provides total electron content
(TEC) maps of their associate analysis centers (Hernandez-Pajares et al., 2009). The maps provide the vertical TEC, which is an integral measurement of the electron density covering the whole ionosphere and
plasmasphere. This ionospheric parameter was used by several studies of the delayed ionospheric response
to solar activity changes due to the 27-day solar rotation period (Afraimovich et al., 2008; Jacobi et al., 2016;
Min et al., 2009; Oinats et al., 2008; Schmdlter et al., 2018, 2020). Cai et al. (2020a, 2020) and showed a good
correlation between TEC maps and Nyx maps. Thus, an investigation of the ionospheric response to solar
activity changes based on comparison of IGS TEC maps and GOLD data is justified.

The present study uses the rapid high-rate solution (UHR) IGS TEC maps provided by the Universitat
Politécnica de Catalunya (UPC). The sampling rate of these maps is 1 h and they are processed by applying
a global voxel-defined 2-layer tomographic model solved with Kalman filter and spline interpolation (Hernndez-Pajares et al., 2016; Orus et al., 2005). The UHR TEC maps are provided by NASA through the Crustal
Dynamics Data Information System (NASA, 2020).

3. Results
3.1. Comparison of Solar EUV Proxies and Measurements

The time series of F10.7, GOLD Qguy and SEM solar EUV flux in Figure 1 show differences between all
three data sets from January 2019 to December 2019. There is an ongoing decrease of Qguy and solar EUV
flux from April 2019 to July 2019 (approximately 10%) which is superimposed with stronger variations
over shorter time periods. From July 2019 onward both data sets have an upward trend but Qguy increases
stronger than the solar EUV flux. The described trend does not occur in the F10.7 data which instead show
a constant trend superimposed with stronger variations over shorter time periods. A more detailed representation of the correlation between solar EUV flux and both proxies is shown in Figure 2 for different

time scales at each day of the year. The correlation between the solar EUV flux and both proxies is especially
strong from April 27, 2019 to June 19, 2019 with correlations coefficients of 0.85 for F10.7 and 0.97 for Qeuy.
This good correlation is due to two well-defined 27-day solar rotation periods occurring in each data set
(see Figure 1). The first and second cycle vary approximately similar for the solar EUV flux and Qguy but
are influenced by the ongoing decrease from April 2019 to July 2019. The difference between the first and
second cycle is much stronger for F10.7 and a different trend is observed. This explains the lower correlation
with the solar EUV flux. Nevertheless, all three time series represent the variations due to the 27-day solar
rotation during this period and can be applied for an analysis of the delayed ionospheric response.

At longer time scales the correlation coefficients of F10.7 in Figure 2a decrease less than the correlation
coefficients of Qeuy in Figure 2b. This trend continues until F10.7 correlates even better with the solar EUV
flux than Qguy. For example, for the whole year the correlation coefficient of solar EUV flux and F10.7 is
0.70 and the correlation coefficient of solar EUV flux and Qguy is 0.63.

3.2. Comparison of Solar Proxies and TEC

The correlation of solar proxies and TEC is known to vary with several parameters. Local time, geographic
or geomagnetic coordinates, seasons and the solar cycle can have different impacts on the ionospheric response (TEC) to solar activity (F10.7, EUV) in each hemisphere (Bergeot et al., 2010; Liu & Chen, 2009). In
order to investigate the ionospheric response to the solar activity changes within the 27-day solar rotation
period a fixed location (geographic longitude of 0° and latitude of 0°) has been chosen. This allows the
comparison of two well-defined 27-day solar rotation periods, which can be observed for maximum TEC
from 12:00 LT to 14:00 LT.

Figure 3 shows the time series of F10.7 and maximum TEC from January 2019 to December 2019 as well
as a smoothed spline interpolation of each data set. The interpolation is calculated using basis splines with
chosen smoothing factors allowing the extraction of the 27-day solar rotation period. The seasonal variations of TEC in Figure 3b are much stronger than the variations due to the solar activity changes, but during
two periods (from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019) a noticeable
correlation of F10.7 and TEC can be observed. In each time period a 27-day peak occurs in both data sets.
During the first period F10.7 increases from approximately 70 to 80 sfu. The second period shows a smaller

increase. Such well-defined increases with corresponding ionospheric
responses are not observed during other periods of the year 2019. The
corresponding peaks of TEC are superimposed with a constant decrease
from March 2019 until July 2019. Figure 4 confirms that there is no direct correlation of F10.7 and TEC for the whole time period (correlation
coefficient of 0.03). The correlation could be improved, for example, by
removing seasonal and spatial variations of the TEC values. This is not
needed for the further analysis though, since its focus are the discussed
27-day solar rotation periods, which appear in both data sets.

Figure 5a shows the selected solar EUV flux proxy Quy from January
2019 to December 2019. TEC values in Figure 5b are selected at corresponding times of the Qeyy measurements. The same interpolation as in
Figure 3 is applied to retrieve smoothed trends. The difference between
F10.7 in Figure 3a and Qguy in Figure 5a are most significant during the
middle of the year. F10.7 has a negligible decrease during this time, but
Quy has a noticeable decrease of approximately 10% (see also Figure 1).
The two periods from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23,

2019 to June 19, 2019 also show two significant peaks for each data set in Figure 5. Unlike the trend of F10.7,
the peaks of Qguy are superimposed with an ongoing decrease similar to the trend of TEC. The correlation
of Qeuy and TEC is shown in Figure 6 for the whole time period (correlation coefficient of 0.69).

The significant changes of the solar activity from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23, 2019 to
June 19, 2019 cause corresponding ionospheric variations (See gray areas in Figures 3 and 5). Therefore,
these periods are appropriate for the analysis of the delayed ionospheric response. An analysis over longer
periods (e.g., the whole year) would require the consideration of seasonal and spatial variations of the ionospheric state (TEC), but such a broad investigation is not aim of this study.

3.3. Comparison of Peak Electron Density and TEC

Figure 7 shows the peak electron density Nya, and TEC in the available
time period from March 2019 to December 2019. TEC values have been
selected at measurement times of Nyx (from 17:00 LT to 21:00 LT). Therefore, a different situation compared to Figures 3 and 5 is presented, since
at these times the ionosphere is dominated by recombination and not
ionization (Rishbeth & Mendillo, 2001). This explains the lower TEC values in Figure 7 (TEC = 10.28 TECU) compared to Figure 3 (TEC = 22.86
TECU) and Figure 5 (TEC = 20.33 TECU). The correlation of Nya, and

TEC is moderate (correlation coefficient of 0.59) and, thus, similar to the

3.4. Ionospheric Response to the 27-Day Solar Rotation Period

Figure 9 shows the correlations of the two chosen 27-day solar rotation periods, which are extracted from
Figures 3 and 5. The correlation of F10.7 and corresponding TEC (correlation coefficient of 0.59) as well
as Qguy and corresponding TEC (correlation coefficient of 0.55) are moderate. Especially, the correlation
of F10.7 and corresponding TEC is improved for this shorter time period compared to the correlation for
the year 2019 (see Figure 4). An additional trend is calculated for each data set, which removes the linear
change of each time series during these periods. The resulting trends in Figure 10 (blue lines) are an acceptable approximation of the 27-day solar rotation period.

Each period is defined by a peak with corresponding peak time and maximum value which vary for each
data set. The maximum values of F10.7 in Figures 10a and 10b, Qguy in Figures 10c and 10d as well as TEC
in Figures 10e and 10f have differences of 6.92 sfu (~8%), 0.07 erg cm™* s ’ (4%) and 6.90 TECU (=28%),

July 2019 seen in Figures 3b and 5b.

The peak time tax of each Parameter P can be calculated by simply extracting the time of the maximum
according to

tmax (P) = argmax(P). (3)

The calculated peak times can be seen in Figure 10. The different peak times for both 27-day solar rotation
periods can be related similar to Equation 2 by

lmax (F10.7) < Cmax (Ozuv ) < lmax (TEC) (4)

defining a delayed ionospheric response to the 27-day solar rotation period, which was investigated in
preceding studies with similar observations or modeling results, for example, Ren et al. (2018). The delay t
can be specified using the solar activity proxy S (F10.7 or Qguy) and TEC according to

t(TEC,S) = tax (TEC) — tmax (S). (5)

The delay between TEC and F10.7 in Figures 10a and 10e is 3.13 days and the delay between TEC and F10.7

(Ren et al., 2018; SchmOlter et al., 2018, 2020), but similar values have been reported in older publications
(Afraimovich et al., 2008; Jakowski et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2012; Min et al., 2009; Oinats et al., 2008; Zhang &
Holt, 2008). The calculation process of the delay introduces uncertainties due to the applied basis spline interpolation and smoothing or due to the temporal resolution of the data. These uncertainties have a stronger
impact for calculations using F10.7 which is measured at daily resolution. Nevertheless, the results can be
used to compare the delayed ionospheric response during both 27-day solar rotation periods.

The delay between TEC and Qguy in Figures 10c and 10e is 0.08 days and the delay between TEC and Qguy
in Figures 10d and 10f is 1.00 days. These results are much closer to calculated delays in recent studies (Ren
et al., 2018; SchméOlter et al., 2018, 2020). The mentioned influence of uncertainties caused by the interpolation process is less due to the higher sampling rate of Qgyy compared to F10.7. Therefore, a smaller difference to studies based on EUV measurements is expected, for example, Schmdlter et al. (2020).

The delayed ionospheric response to the 27-day solar rotation period can also be estimated with cross-correlation analysis (SchmOlter et al., 2018, 2020). This method fits the data for the whole time period and the
calculated results are expected to be different to the delay estimated based on the peak time of the 27-day
solar rotation period. The cross-correlation analysis does not require any filtering of the data and therefore
no basis spline interpolation is applied. The cross-correlation for a solar proxy S and the ionospheric state P
given by maximum TEC is calculated by

and the delay is estimated according to
t(P,S) = argmax ((P ** S)) (7)

The sampling rate of the estimated cross-correlation is defined by the input data set with the lower sampling
rate. Therefore, the results based on F1.07 and TEC have a sampling rate of 1 day and the results based on
Qruv and TEC have a sampling rate of 1 h. The delay estimation by cross-correlation analysis benefits from
the higher resolution of Qguv.

The results of the cross-correlation analysis for both solar proxies from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and
from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019 are shown in Figure 11. The most significant difference compared to
the results in Figure 10 is the cross-correlation based on F10.7 for the second period in Figure 11b. The
cross-correlation has no pronounced peak and a reasonable estimation of a delay is not possible in this case.
The first period in Figure 11a shows a delay of 0 days. The differences of the results compared to the trends
in Figure 10 are most likely due to the lack of smoothing leading to the inclusion of smaller features in
this approach. The results of the cross-correlation analysis based on Qguy have a pronounced peak for both
periods and delays of 1 and 13 h are estimated. These delays are also different from the trends in Figure 10
but the increase of the delay during the second period is confirmed. As explained, the comparison of peak
times and the cross-correlation analysis describe different delays, but the benefit of higher sampling rates is
greater with the cross-correlation analysis.

The results in Figures 10 and 11 confirm previous studies. The solar activity is a driving factor of the delayed
ionospheric response (Ren et al., 2018; SchmOlter et al., 2020) which is impacted by its change even during
a solar minimum with low solar and geomagnetic activity. The O/N, column density ratio also influences
the response time of the ionosphere to solar activity changes (Ren et al., 2018) and is even more important
during the chosen time periods with low solar activity (Rishbeth, 1998). Figure 12 shows the O/N, column
density ratio from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019. The O/N, column density ratio trend does not correlate with the two observed 27-day solar rotation periods (correlation
coefficient of 0.24 with F10.7 and correlation coefficient of 0.06 with Qguy). The occurring variations are
on smaller time scales and and no general trend for the whole periods can be reliably estimated. Therefore,
only the mean values of each time period are compared. The mean O/N, column density ratio decreases

from 1.06 in the first period to 1.03 in the second period (approximately 3%). This trend could be related to
the to the ongoing decrease of the solar activity from March 2019 to July 2019 that is superimposed with
the analyzed 27-day solar rotation periods (see Figures 1b and 1c), but other processes could impact the O/
N, column density ratio as well, for example, temperature, density, or wind changes caused by atmospheric
waves (He et al., 2010).

The O/N, column density ratio is known to modulate the ionospheric response time (Ren et al., 2018) and
to be impacted by the change of solar activity itself (Luan et al., 2017). The influence of solar activity and O/
N, column density ratio is defined according to Equation 8 which describes the photochemical equilibrium
in the F region (Rishbeth, 1998).

The electron density n is given by ion production q and loss 6. The production is defined by the atomic
oxygen concentration [O] and the factor I,, that is proportional to the flux of solar ionizing radiation (Rishbeth, 1998). The loss is defined by the molecular oxygen concentration [O,] and the molecular nitrogen
concentration [N,| with two corresponding coefficients k (Rishbeth, 1998). The solar activity controls directly the production and the O/N, column density ratio controls production as well as loss. An increase of
the production caused by a solar activity increase, an O/N, column density ratio increase or both relates to
a longer ionospheric response time (Ren et al., 2018; Schmdlter et al., 2020).

The solar activity and its change is stronger during the period from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 compared
to the period from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019. A longer response time for the first period is expected
according to this difference and the established understanding (considering only the response to the 27-day
solar rotation period). The O/N, column density ratio is also increased during the first period but the difference is not significant enough to analyze the influence on the delayed ionospheric response. In addition, the
processes controlling the O/N, column density ratio are complex (He et al., 2010; Luan et al., 2017) and the
characterization of their impact would require an extensive analysis that is beyond the scope of this study,
for example, a spatial analysis for different regions covered by GOLD measurements.

for the second time period. Considering the good correlation of Qguy in the chosen time period with actual
solar EUV flux measurements (see Figures 1 and 2) and the moderate correlation with TEC (see Figure 9)
the delays estimated based on this parameter are expected to be more reliable. Therefore, the change of the
delay does not align with expectations which could be due to various processes impacting the ionospheric

state (e.g., plasma transport due to the equatorial plasma fountain effect) or due to uncertainties in the applied methods. The more complex changes of the O/N, column density ratio in Figure 12 could also explain
parts of the observed trend, but the estimated delays are not precise enough to perform such an analysis
(e.g., due to the sampling rate). The overall O/N, column density ratio trend follows the TEC variations
though, which is of interest for future studies to analyze the seasonal variations of the delayed ionospheric
response in more detail (SchméOlter et al., 2020). Especially, the combination of different GOLD data (solar
EUV flux proxy Qguv, O/N, column density ratio and eventually O, density profile) allows a comprehensive
analysis when longer time periods of data are available, for example, by applying superposed epoch analysis.

4. Conclusion

The analysis of F10.7, Qeuy, Nuax, O/N2 column density and TEC has given a first impression of the capabilities of GOLD data in analyzing the delayed ionospheric response to the 27-day solar rotation period. The
following results were obtained in the current study and represent an important starting point for future
research in this area:

1. The solar proxies F10.7 and Qgyy show noticeable differences, but are in good agreement for at least
two solar rotation periods during the year 2019. The delayed ionospheric response time to the 27-day
solar rotation periods from April 27, 2019 to May 24, 2019 and from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019 could
be retrieved using both data sets (see Figure 10). Qguy is a more reliable proxy than F10.7, which is not
synchronized with the solar EUV radiation at all times (Chen et al., 2011, 2018). Therefore, Qgyy should
be used in data analyses of the ionospheric response to solar activity changes but also for ionospheric
modeling approaches

2. Qguy and corresponding TEC are in good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.69). The estimated delays based on Qgyy and TEC are similar to the results of studies using actual EUV measurements and
TEC, for example, SchmOlter et al. (2020)

3. Nwax and corresponding TEC are in good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.59). The daily GOLD
measurements of Nyax from 17:00 LT to 21:00 LT are of interest to analyze accumulation processes within the delayed ionospheric response

4. The O/N, column density ratio provides additional information to the analysis of the delayed ionospheric response considering its importance as shown in preceding studies (Ren et al., 2018; Schmdlter
et al., 2020). An analysis of longer periods with varying solar activity and O/N, column density ratio
conditions might allow to estimate their respective impact on the delay

5. It is important to investigate the different ionospheric processes during ionization and recombination
periods of the 27-day solar rotation period based on maximum and late noon TEC. GOLD data (Qguy,
Nwmax and O/N, column density ratio) provide critical additional information exactly during these periods

6. Delays t(TEC, F10.7) of 3.13 and 2.42 days and delays t(TEC, Qguv) of 0.08 and 1.00 days are estimated
by comparison of the peak times of the two 27-day solar rotation periods from April 27, 2019 to May 24,
2019 and from May 23, 2019 to June 19, 2019. The results based on Qguy are qualitatively confirmed with
a cross-correlation analysis that estimates respective delays of 0.04 and 0.54 days

GOLD data offer the potential to gain more knowledge about the response of the ionosphere to solar activity
and to better characterize the occurring delay. The combination of different parameters can contribute to
identify their respective impacts on the ionospheric delay. In conclusion, we strongly recommend to include
GOLD data in future studies of the delayed ionospheric response to solar EUV radiation.
