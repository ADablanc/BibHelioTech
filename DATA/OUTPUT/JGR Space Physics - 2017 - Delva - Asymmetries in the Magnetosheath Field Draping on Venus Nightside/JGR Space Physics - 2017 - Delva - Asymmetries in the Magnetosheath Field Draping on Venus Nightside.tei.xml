<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Draping features of the interplanetary magnetic field around nonmagnetic bodies, especially Venus, have been studied in detail in numerical simulations and also from observations. Existing analytical and numerical work for nonperpendicular interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind velocity direction show a kink in the draped fieldlines in the near magnetosheath on the quasi-parallel side of the bow shock. Here long-term magnetic field data from the Venus Express mission (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014) are analyzed in the near-nightside region of the magnetosheath, searching for differences in the draping pattern between the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular side of the shock. From these magnetometer (MAG) data, the kink in the fieldlines occurring only on the quasi-parallel side is clearly identified from the change of sign in the field component parallel to the solar wind velocity. Furthermore, an asymmetry in the deflection of the out-of-plane field component due to the slipping of the fieldlines over the planetary obstacle is also found, which confirms predictions from numeral studies and from earlier work.</p></div>

Also, the motional electric field E = ÀV SW × B SW , which is perpendicular to the (V SW ,B SW ) plane, plays an important role for the interaction with charged particles and leads to asymmetries in the interaction region.</p><p>The bow shock and bilobed nature of the plasma tail were already detected by <ref type="bibr">Venera-9 and Venera-10 (Dolginov et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vaisberg et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zelenyi &amp; Vaisberg, 1982)</ref>. Different asymmetry effects were reported from PVO for different regions of the tail (magnetosheath and plasma tail), mainly depending on the direction of the upstream motional electric field E (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Slavin et al., 1989)</ref>. The bilobed nature of the inner plasma tail was also confirmed from PVO data (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Saunders &amp; Russell, 1986)</ref>, and asymmetries were found in the draping of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the magnetosheath, which depend on the upstream IMF component transverse to the solar wind velocity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Phillips et al., 1986)</ref>. In detail, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Phillips et al. (1986)</ref> found stronger fluctuations of the magnetic field in the magnetosheath near or downstream from the quasiparallel section of the bow shock. Several numerical simulations showed more details of the inner structure in the magnetosheath and tail (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Spreiter &amp; Stahara, 1980)</ref>, which were compared to results from further data analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Luhmann et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McComas et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Slavin et al., 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, more details have been added with data from the Venus Express spacecraft. The PVO and Venus Express spacecraft have visited a different range in space around the planet, especially in the tail: PVO passed through the distant tail, whereas Venus Express only visited the near-tail region.</p><p>From magnetometer and plasma data from Venus Express, already known asymmetry effects have been confirmed and new ones discovered: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al. (2010)</ref> confirmed the bilobed nature of the tail and found also an asymmetry in closer wrapping of the IMF around the planet in the hemisphere where E points toward the planet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dubinin et al. (2013)</ref> reported about plasma sheet asymmetries controlled by the direction of the motional electric field, with higher acceleration and lower plasma density in the hemisphere where E is pointing away from the planet (positive E hemisphere). A stronger magnetosheath magnetic field in the positive E hemisphere was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Du et al. (2013)</ref>; these authors also confirmed the closer wrapping around the planet in the negative E hemisphere. In the near-Venus magnetotail, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rong et al. (2014)</ref> found that the asymmetry of the cross-flow component B y (with more negative B y in the negative E hemisphere) is formed near the terminator plane and transported tailward, as well as a sinking E equatorward of the draped magnetic fieldlines in the near tail. Also, other hemispheric asymmetries occur when the undisturbed IMF and the solar wind velocity are not perpendicular, but there exists a flow-aligned component of the IMF. This work studies specifically cases of oblique IMF and solar wind velocity and searches for draping asymmetries depending on the direction of the IMF to or away from the Sun. The paper is organized as follows: first, the basic reference frames used are explained. Then the details of the asymmetric IMF draping from global numerical simulations of the Venus-solar wind interaction for oblique IMF and solar wind velocity are described, and what effects will be searched for in the Venus Express data. The method for the data analysis, the observations, and new findings are presented, and a comparison with previously reported asymmetries is discussed. The paper is completed by a summary and conclusions of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Reference Frames and Terminology</head><p>The basic coordinate systems, both Venus centered, used in this study are the Venus-Solar Orbital (VSO) reference frame and the Venus electromagnetical (VBE) reference frame. The solar wind velocity V SW is taken radially outward from the Sun, that is, the aberration caused by the orbital motion of Venus around the Sun is neglected as it is not expected to be a major factor in our analysis. The VSO frame has the (x,y) VSO plane coinciding with the Venus orbital plane, where x VSO is directed to the Sun, y VSO is opposite to the planet's orbital velocity, and z VSO is perpendicular to the (x,y) VSO plane and positive to ecliptic north. In the VBE reference frame x VBE is positive toward the Sun and opposite to the upstream solar wind velocity V SW (i.e., x VBE = x VSO ), y VBE is along the cross-flow component of the upstream IMF, and z VBE points in the direction of the upstream motional electric field E. The VBE frame is obtained from the VSO frame through a rotation around the x VSO axis such that the y VBE axis is aligned with the IMF component perpendicular to the x VSO axis, that is, rotation over the clock angle ϕ = atan(B zVSO /B yVSO ). Then the vector B SW is in the (x,y) VBE plane and the cross-flow component B ySW,VBE is always positive and B zSW,VBE is zero. The hemisphere around Venus with the upstream solar wind motional electric field pointing away from the planet is called the positive E hemisphere (z VBE &gt; 0), and the upstream solar wind motional electric pointing toward the planet is called the negative E hemisphere (z VBE &lt; 0). The hemisphere containing the quasi-parallel side of the bow shock is called the BS par hemisphere, and the corresponding region in the magnetosheath is called MS par . The hemisphere with the quasi-perpendicular side of the bow shock is called the BS perp hemisphere, and the corresponding region in the magnetosheath is called MS perp . The radius of Venus is used as the unit of length (R V = 6051.5 km).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Asymmetries in the Magnetosheath for Oblique IMF and V SW</head><p>Global numerical simulations produce hemispheric asymmetries between the BS par and BS perp hemispheres in the Venus-induced magnetosphere depending on the angle (B SW ,V SW ) between the upstream IMF and solar wind velocity vectors. Notably, models show asymmetries for strongly nonperpendicular upstream IMF and the solar wind velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Jarvinen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kallio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ma et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Terada et al., 2009)</ref>. The sign of the flow-aligned component (B x ) of the IMF defines the BS par and BS perp hemispheres when the simulation is performed in the VBE coordinate system. The BS par hemisphere is the y VBE &lt; 0 hemisphere, and BS perp hemisphere is the y VBE &gt; 0 hemisphere when the flow-aligned component of the IMF points away from the Sun (B x &lt; 0). With the flow-aligned component of the IMF pointing toward the Sun (B x &gt; 0), the BS par hemisphere is the y VBE &gt; 0 hemisphere and BS perp hemisphere is the y VBE &lt; 0 hemisphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jarvinen et al. (2008)</ref> derived the correlation of the upstream IMF B x and B y components showing variations around the Parker spiral at Venus based on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (from <ref type="bibr">Jarvinen et al., 2013, Figure 6 therein)</ref> shows the three-dimensional draped IMF pattern for the outward Parker spiral from three view points in a global hybrid simulation of the Venus-solar wind interaction. The authors especially analyze the magnetic fieldlines and plasma velocities in the plasma environment near to the planet and farther down in the tail. A strong asymmetry in the IMF draping is evident between the BS par and BS perp hemispheres, with stronger magnetic barrier on the BS perp side. But the IMF draping on the BS par hemisphere is much stronger: the fieldlines are connected to the undisturbed IMF upstream of Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 10.1002/2017JA024604 the induced magnetosphere, which leads to a kink, whereas on the BS perp hemisphere the connection to the upstream IMF occurs far beyond the terminator plane (beyond the simulation domain).</p><p>The region of interest in our study is marked with a red rectangle in the (x,y) VBE plane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), indicating the kink in the fieldlines, only present on the BS par side of the magnetosheath. The change from the outward upstream IMF direction (B x &lt; 0) to the draped configuration directed perpendicular to the upstream solar wind velocity (B x = 0) and finally toward the Sun and to the planet (B x &gt; 0) occurs in a narrow region in the near-nightside magnetosheath within the red rectangle. In contrast, the opposite side (BS perp ) shows a smooth transition from the draped IMF back to the upstream B SW direction.</p><p>Furthermore, an analytical solution for the draping of the fieldlines was developed for the idealized case of a steady state magnetohydrodynamic flow around an unmagnetized conducting sphere by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Romanelli et al. (2014)</ref>. Here a clear distinction is found for oblique B SW and V SW , with a kink in the tailward draped fieldlines on the quasi-parallel side of the shock.</p><p>So far, the asymmetry in the IMF draping in the magnetosheath for nonperpendicular IMF and the solar wind velocity as function of the angle (B SW ,V SW ) was not verified from the Venus Express data. It is the purpose of this paper to search for the asymmetry in the magnetosheath draping pattern from the Venus Express MAG data of the full mission time interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Analysis Method</head><p>The MAG data available from the Venus Express spacecraft in elliptical orbits span the long time interval from 10 May 2006 to 25 November 2014 (12.8 Venus years); time resolution of the data is 1 Hz continually for each full orbital period of 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Zhang et al., 2006)</ref> or shorter orbital period in the later stages of the mission. The spacecraft's polar orbit is an ellipse with pericenter near the Venus' north pole; the pericenter altitude was mainly at 280-400 km but lowered to 180 km during some time intervals in a later stage of the mission. The pericenter is always located within the bow shock; the space visited on the nightside is restricted to the near tail (x sc &gt; À3.2 Venus radii R V ). The reference frame of the MAG data set is the VSO coordinate system. The time span covers part of the solar minimum of Solar Cycle 23 <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref> and of increasing solar activity to solar maximum of the next cycle <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>. For inward IMF and in/near the Venus' orbital plane (B SW is directed toward the Sun), the motional electric field E points to Venus' south pole; thus, the spacecraft's apocenter (at altitude 66,000 km) is in the positive E hemisphere leading to more data in that hemisphere. For outward IMF and in/near the Venus' orbital plane (B SW is directed away from the Sun), the motional electric field E points to Venus' north pole with the orbital pericenter and less data are sampled in the positive E hemisphere. So for a data set of a full orbit and constant data sampling at 1 Hz, the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jarvinen et al., 2013)</ref>. The coloring of the field lines gives the B x component of the magnetic field. The background coloring shows the solar wind density in the (X,Z) plane at Y = 0, (X,Y) plane at Z = 0 and (Y,Z) plane at X = À2 R V for context (white/transparent is lower density and black is higher density). The three-dimensional magnetic field line tracing was started in 100 points on a spherical shell at r = R V + 1,000 km. The arrows give the orientation of the upstream solar wind electric field (E SW ), velocity (V SW ), and the IMF (B SW ). The sphere has the radius of Venus, and the white hemisphere of the sphere is the dayside and the black hemisphere is the nightside of the planet. The region of interest is MS par , marked by the red rectangle in the middle panel.</p><p>Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics 10.1002/2017JA024604 spacecraft spends more time and samples more data near the apocenter, always leading to a higher data availability in one specific E hemisphere. Moreover, there is a significant difference in the occurrence of inward or outward IMF during the time interval considered: for the declining phase of Solar Cycle 23, outward IMF was prevalent, for the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24, inward IMF was prevalent at the Venus orbit (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Delva et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mursula &amp; Virtanen, 2012)</ref>. These factors have to be taken into account to keep the data analysis unbiased by the larger number of available data samples in one specific hemisphere during parts of the investigated time interval. Therefore, simple time averaging of the data shall be omitted.</p><p>To study the orientation of the draped field in the nightside region of the magnetosheath and near tail, we use only orbits with steady conditions of the unshocked IMF. For the available data set, the average B SW components were determined before each inbound and after the outbound bow shock (BS) crossing (with the pericenter pass in between), which have a time difference of ~2-4 h. The average B SW is determined from a 20 min time interval at least 20 min out of the BS crossings; the clock angle ϕ = atan(B zVSO /B yVSO ) and cone angle θ = acos(B xVSO /B t ) of the mean B SW at the inbound BS crossing are calculated; B t denotes the total field value. To guarantee sufficiently stable IMF conditions per orbit, only the orbits with an angular variation in the direction of the mean B SW less than 30°are selected. Although fluctuations of the IMF direction also occur on a shorter time scale, the limit of max. 30°change in the B direction between the BS crossings is an often used criterion for sufficiently stable IMF conditions (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Du et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dubinin et al., 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, all orbits with cone angle θ &lt; 10°, respectively, θ &gt; 170°are excluded, to omit uncertainties in the inward/outward direction of the IMF.</p><p>For these selected orbits with steady IMF, the magnetic field data and the spacecraft position, both in VSO, are rotated over the clock angle into the VBE reference frame. From here on, we use only the VBE reference frame (unless otherwise stated), and therefore, the subscripts VBE are dropped in the rest of the paper.</p><p>For each of the stable orbits, only data in the spatial region of interest are selected, that is, for X sc in [À3.2, À1.2], Y sc , and Z sc in [À3.0, +3.0]. In the (Y,Z) plane, a grid is defined with grid size [0.2 × 0.2]; for X only one interval was used, within [À3.2, À1.2], but with size depending on the case under study (see next chapter). For each single-spacecraft orbit, the data sampled in one box of the grid are averaged and the data stored, which means that each orbit represents only one count and one value per spatial bin visited by the spacecraft. This omits the problem of a stronger contribution of data bins closer to the apocenter, while those always contain a larger number of 1 Hz data samples. Taking simple time averages of all 1 Hz, data sampled in one spatial bin would bias the data in one or the other E hemisphere, depending on the value of the cone angle. This would especially be the case here, since the timely distribution of the cone angles is not symmetric in terms of inward or outward IMF for the investigated time interval. For the orbits with steady IMF passing through the spatial region of interest, the values are stored and statistics per bin are made, according to positive and negative values of the components B x and B z . We are interested in the spatial variation of the field orientation in the magnetosheath (MS) per orbit, that is, per case of stable IMF conditions and independent from the actual field strength.</p><p>Several numerical simulations in an electromagnetical reference frame show that the draping on the quasiparallel side of the BS (in the MS par hemisphere) is characterized by a change in sign of the B x component, sometimes accompanied by a B y component tending from B ySW &gt; 0 to small values (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jarvinen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ma et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a sketch of the situation for both inward and outward IMF; the kink in the fieldlines in the MS is only found on the quasi-parallel side of the BS. Due to the small size of the dayside BS at Venus, the kink is seen mainly beyond the terminator plane. For inward B SW (θ &lt; 90°, left panel), the kink can be detected from a change of sign in B x from B xSW &gt; 0 in the undraped IMF to B x &lt; 0 inside the MS. For outward B SW (θ &gt; 90°, right panel), the kink's signature is a change from B xSW &lt; 0 in the undraped IMF to B x &gt; 0 in the MS. If draping in the MS is strong, B may be nearly parallel to the x axis before and after the change of sign, that is, the B y component may also decrease to a small value.</p></div>

There were 543 orbits with stable IMF conditions passing through the spatial region of interest. The spatial distribution of the orbits or counts (since one orbit passing through the bin is one count) is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, for both IMF cone angle cases. The nonuniformity of the counts in the respective E hemispheres is due to the polar spacecraft orbit with pericenter near VSO north. This means that due the spacecraft orbit, for inward IMF laying approximately in the Venus orbit, the spacecraft spends more time near apocenter in the positive E hemisphere, whereas for outward IMF, more time is spent near apocenter in the negative E hemisphere. Since all orbits pass through the pericenter, the highest number of counts occurs always around the pericenter for both cone angle cases. Normal averaging of the initial B data with 1 Hz data resolution over the bins would have favored the apocenter region and the respective E hemisphere.</p><p>The BS intersection with the terminator plane, indicated in all figures, was calculated from a static BS model determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang et al.

In the VBE reference frame, the undraped field outside of the bow shock is confined to the (X,Y) plane and the B z component is zero.

Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c and 6d</ref> show the draped B z becoming positive (red) in the BS par hemisphere and negative (blue) in the BS perp hemisphere.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Asymmetries in the Magnetosheath</head><p>In the presented study, we find the kink in the MS fieldlines on the quasi-parallel side of the bow shock, which is absent on the quasi-perpendicular side. This means that the fieldlines on the quasi-perpendicular side are smoothly connected with unshocked IMF; the direction of B x (inward or outward) remains unchanged throughout the MS and into the central tail. However, on the quasi-parallel side, the fieldlines show a directional change from the original IMF-B x direction to the opposite direction, that is, two opposite B directions occur on that side of the MS, confined in a narrow space between the bow shock and the magnetic barrier. Since the plasma itself reacts on the magnetic field and its changes, a distinct difference in the plasma behavior is expected between the two magnetosheath sides.</p><p>Indeed, the numerical hybrid simulations performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jarvinen et al. (2013)</ref> for the nominal Parker spiral angle case with outward IMF display significant differences in the magnetic field and plasma properties between MS par and MS perp . As described in detail in Chapter 2, significant influences on the plasma properties are found. The planetary ion escape fluxes are concentrated on the BS par hemisphere, and the velocities of planetary ions are smaller than those in the perpendicular IMF case.</p><p>A study of magnetosheath plasma data, separated for the two cone angle cases, could give observational evidence for these differences. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper. As already discussed in Chapter 4.2, numerous previous studies, for example, from PVO at Venus, at other nonmagnetic bodies and from simulations reported that a bilobed structure of the inner tail is established, independent of the cone angle of the unshocked outer IMF. The regular draping pattern is such that in the VBE reference frame, the negative Y tailside has a B field toward the planet (B x &gt; 0) and the positive Y tailside has B field tailward from the planet (B x &lt; 0). Our study confirms the independency of the bilobed nature of the inner tail from the cone angle, but this is valid only for the inner tail. In the magnetosheath, we find that the situation is different and depends on the inward or outward direction of the undisturbed B SW .</p><p>In a previous study from the Venus Express MAG data and for a shorter time interval in the first stage of the mission (May 2006 to December 2008), <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al. (2010)</ref> reported also about an asymmetry in the magnetic field polarity distribution in the E+ and EÀ hemisphere in inner near tail (for X in [À3.0, À1.2] and Y,Z in [À2, +2]). The cross-flow component B y becomes negative in the negative E hemisphere, which is interpreted as closer wrapping of B fieldlines to the planet there. The reversal from B y &gt; 0 in the IMF to B y &lt; 0 produces B field stress directed to the planet and also can modify the plasma transport into the tail in the negative E hemisphere. Simulations in that paper show the same effect in the near tail (X &gt; À1.5) with negative cross-flow component only in the negative E hemisphere.</p><p>To shed more light on this "closer wrapping" of the fieldlines in the near tail, we separate our data now according to the distance in the tail: X sc in [À2.2, À1.2] closer to the planet and X sc in [À3.2, À2.2] deeper in the nightside. Here a separation into cone angle cases is omitted, because the orbital coverage closer to the planet is always near the pericenter and therefore poor in the E hemisphere not containing the pericenter. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the results for the two distances in X: negative values for the cross-flow component B y occur mainly in the negative E hemisphere in the very near tail, X sc in [À2.2, À1.2]. Farther downstream for X sc in [À3.2, À2.2], less negative B y values are found and these are located near the E field equator, in both hemispheres; an E hemisphere asymmetry is not seen there. This result in the farther downstream area, however, is from a much smaller number of orbits, due to the specific orbit of the spacecraft (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, right). We may conclude that the asymmetric "close wrapping" in the negative E hemisphere is a well-localized effect close to the planet, which is not seen farther downstream in the tail.</p><p>A similar result was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Du et al. (2013)</ref>, from a smaller Venus Express MAG data set (April 2006 to December 2009): the closer wrapping for negative cross-flow component B y is found in the negative E hemisphere on the dayside and near nightside, very close to the planet (within 1.5 Rv from the planet tail axis and X &gt; À0.4 R V ) but farther out (X &lt; À0.4 R V ) is found only near the equator, that is, the asymmetry disappears. An explanation for the more close wrapping of the fieldlines in the negative E hemisphere is still outstanding.</p><p>From the Venus Express plasma data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dubinin et al. (2013)</ref> reported on a different asymmetry in the plasma sheet (approximately within 1 R V from the tail center line); the authors found a distinct asymmetry in supply of the plasma sheet between the positive and negative E hemisphere. The negative E hemisphere is denser, which is explained by more ion supply due to the j × B force; the positive E hemisphere is less dense and the ions have higher velocities. This asymmetry is attributed to the action of the motional electric field. With a The cross-flow component B y was found to have an asymmetry with more B y &lt; 0 in the negative E hemisphere in the region closest to the planet but mainly positive B y everywhere in the outer region. This is in agreement with our result here that the close wrapping with B y &lt; 0 in the negative E hemisphere is confined to the space closest to the planet.</p><p>In our work, we do not identify a distinct difference between the two E hemispheres; all described effects are approximately symmetric with respect to the E equatorial plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>We investigated the orientation of the magnetic field in the near-nightside magnetosheath of Venus using the magnetometer data from the Venus Express spacecraft for the time duration of the whole mission (May 2006 to 25 November 2014), in search for asymmetries depending on the inward or outward direction of the IMF. From theory and numerical simulations, it is known that for oblique orientation of the solar wind magnetic field B SW and velocity V SW , the fieldlines are draped differently on the quasi-parallel or quasiperpendicular side of the shock: on the quasi-parallel side, the component parallel to V SW is reversed, leading to a kink in the fieldlines, whereas on the quasi-perpendicular side, a smooth transition from the unshocked IMF to the draped field inside the MS occurs.</p><p>From the available data set of 12.8 Venus years, the orbits with steady IMF directions between BS inbound and outbound crossing were selected, and the field components in the MS range behind the terminator plane (X sc in [À3.2, À1.2], Y sc , Z sc in [À3.0, +3.0] in R V ) analyzed. The predicted asymmetry between the quasi-parallel und quasi-perpendicular side of the MS was clearly demonstrated. The quasi-perpendicular side maintains the original IMF orientation nearly uniformly throughout the whole MS half until the noonmidnight plane, whereas the quasi-parallel side experiences the change in the flow-aligned field component (B x ) from the original IMF direction at the BS to the opposite sign near the magnetic barrier, leading to a kink in the draped fieldlines. The asymmetric magnetic configuration in the MS has significant effects on the plasma; hybrid numerical simulations have shown different plasma properties in the MS sides, but these have not yet been verified from plasma data. However, such analysis is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>Furthermore, the magnetic field was found to develop an out-of-the-plane component B z , such that the field direction returns to the original upstream plane (B SW in Z = 0 plane) behind the planet: in the positive (negative) E hemisphere and looking in direction of the draped field, a positive (negative) B z component develops before the fieldline slips over (under) the planet and a negative (positive) B z after the slip over (under) the planet, that is, the fieldlines sink back to the original plane Z = 0. This is a confirmation of the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rong et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>The more "close wrapping" of the fieldlines with a change of sign in the cross-flow component B y behind the planet in the negative E hemisphere was confirmed but is found to be confined to a small region just behind the terminator plane. Farther downstream in the nightside, a change of sign in B y is only found near the equatorial plane of the E hemispheres, with no noticeable asymmetry. This is in agreement with earlier findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Du et al. (2013)</ref>. So far, an explanation for the asymmetry effect of more close wrapping in the negative E hemisphere is still outstanding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
