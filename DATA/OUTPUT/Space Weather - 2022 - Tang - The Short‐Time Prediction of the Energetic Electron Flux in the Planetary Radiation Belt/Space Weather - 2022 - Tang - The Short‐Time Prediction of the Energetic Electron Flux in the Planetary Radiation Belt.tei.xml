However, based on the requirements of energy limits and physical dimensions in satellites, the smart chips used in the instruments can not have very powerful computing power, which may not be effective for current long-time space weather predictions with many large-scale parameters. In the present study, we present a short-time electron flux forecast in planetary radiation belts whose experiments only consider the historical flux data and local parameters. We used five different machine learning models to give the short-time prediction of the electron differential fluxes for all 20 energy levels from tens of keV to several MeV based on RBSP-A observations. We also verified this ensemble model on the electron flux forecast near Saturn's equatorial plane by using CASSINI/MIMI data. Our work give a new insight in the space weather applications based on machine learning, which will be critical for practical applications to the instrument designs and system operations of new scientific satellites in the space radiation environment. solar activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(He et al., 2008)</ref>, space weather forecast <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bala et al., 2009)</ref>, global TEC map (Z. <ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019)</ref>, and solar flare predictions <ref type="bibr">(Tang, Zeng, et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">, Tang, Liao et al., 2021)</ref> etc. Recently, neural network has gradually been applied to solve these problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Myagkova et al.

We understand that the space environment is very complicated and associated with so many conditions. With the development of AI hardware technology, the deep learning algorithms embedded in FPGA or other microchips have been studied and begun to be used in mobile phones, intelligent robots, self-driving cars, and so on. It can be predicted that those smart chips will soon be applied to various observation instruments carried by space exploration satellites. On the other hand, based on the requirements of energy limits and physical dimensions in satellites, the smart chips used in the instruments can not have very powerful computing power, which may not be effective for current long-time space weather predictions with many large-scale parameters. Therefore, in the present study, we try to present a short-time electron flux forecast in planetary radiation belts whose experiments only consider the historical flux data and local parameters, such as L, MLT and MLAT. By using the RBSP-A/MAGEIS data during March 2013-December 2017, we used five different machine learning models, including the deep neural network (DNN), the convolutional neural network (CNN), the combination of CNN and DNN (CNN&amp;DNN), the linear regression (LR), and the ensemble model of above four models by using light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to give the short-time prediction of the electron differential fluxes for all 20 energy levels from tens of keV to several MeV. The prediction performances and corresponding errors were detailedly compared and discussed. We also simply tested the effects of AE and SYM-H indexes on the LightGBM ensemble model to prove that the short-time prediction only with local parameters are effective and better than these predictions with AE and SYM-H. Furthermore, we verified this ensemble model on the electron flux forecast near Saturn's equatorial plane by using CASSINI/MIMI data. Our work give a new insight in the space weather applications based on machine learning, which will be critical for practical applications to the instrument designs and system operations of new scientific satellites in the space radiation environment.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the models and data of Earth. In Section 3 we present the corresponding experimental results. In Section 4, we apply the models to Saturn and carry out relevant experiments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Electron Flux Data</head><p>In our study, using the observations of Van Allen Probe A, we first performed the electron flux predictions in the Earth's outer radiation belt. The perigee of Van Allen Probe is ∼1.1 R E (radius of the Earth), and its apogee is ∼6.2 R E . The L-shell that we concentrated on is around 3.7 ∼ 7.2, which mainly covers the Earth's outer radiation belt. The observational electron flux data with a 10 s time resolution are provided by the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) level-2 data sets of Van Allen Probe A <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blake et al., 2013)</ref>. Its L-shell values were mainly calculated from the McIlwain's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(McIlwain, 1961)</ref>. The time period is from 31 March 2013 to 31 December 2017, which almost covers three satellite operation cycles. All 20 energy levels, including <ref type="bibr">31.5, 53.8, 79.8, 108.3, 143.5, 183.4, 226.1, 231.8, 342.1, 464.4, 593, 741.6, 901.8, 1077.7, 1547, 1701, 2275, 2651, 3681, and 4216</ref> keV, are finally used in the experiments. Furthermore, geomagnetic activity conditions (AE and SYM-H) were added to compare with the above experiments only with local L, MLT. In order to verify our idea in other planetary radiation belts, we also used the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS) data set of Cassini in Saturn's magnetosphere. LEMMS can detect lower energy electrons (18-832 keV) with the C0-C7 channels and higher energy electrons (0.1-21 MeV) with the E0-E7 channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Krimigis et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Krupp et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>It is well known that the data sampling and selection play a crucial role in the whole deep learning prediction model because the neural network is sensitive to those abnormal values. The following three points must be ensured: (a) the L-shell value cannot be NaN; (b) the L-shell value of two adjacent data points are not too far; (c) L-shell value will not fluctuate greatly, which means that adjacent L values should be within an interval. In our study, the difference between selected adjacent L values is less than 0.01. In order to avoid adding dirty data into the experiments, all data including any NaN in 20 energy levels are all removed. Finally, 9698 819 valid electron flux data samples from original MagEIS instrument have been selected. Based on all valid independent data samples, we have carefully divided into several packages for different time interval of short-time flux predictions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> gives the basic idea of our organizations. First, we should make sure that continuous 30 data samples are prepared as the historical flux data to obtain the prediction results, which is almost 300 s long. Second, the electron flux forecasts at the following N = 45, 60, 90, and 120 time steps will be predicted based on the those historical 30 data samples, which roughly correspond to 7.5 ∼ 20 min backwards. Therefore, according to the above scenario, we cut all 9698 819 into different 30 + N data sets, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. Third, as for the proportion of training set and test set in flux predictions, the experiment data will be chosen as 80%:20%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> gives the specific number of the training and test sets with their time ranges, respectively. It should be noted that all observed electron differential fluxes have been normalized by using the formula Flux norm = (Flux ori − Flux min )/ (Flux max − Flux min ) at each energy level, where Flux ori is the original flux to be normalized, and Flux max and Flux min are the maximum and minimum values at this energy level, respectively. The normalization process can make </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Machine Learning Models</head><p>The models used in this paper include the DNN, the CNN, the combination of CNN and DNN (CNN&amp;DNN), the LR, and the ensemble model of above four models by using the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) method.</p><p>As for the DNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cichy and Kaiser, 2019)</ref>, the neural network is an extension based on perception. Its hierarchical structure can be generally divided into input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Hidden layer is used to extract deep-seated feature information. The deep neural network can be understood as a neural network with many hidden layers, which is also called a multilayer perception.</p><p>The second model is the <ref type="bibr">CNN (LeCun et al., 2015)</ref> which is different from the deep neural network since its function is responsible for local feature extraction. For the hierarchical structure, its hidden layer generally uses the convolutional layer and the pooling layer, so that the convolutional neural network can adopt the local-connection structure between layers.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, the convolutional neural network is a subset of the deep neural network. All the solutions obtained through the convolutional neural network can form a solution of the deep neural network by filling the weight parameters to 0. Therefore, the deep neural network is superior to the convolutional neural network. However, under the influence of computational power and algorithms in many cases, the result of convolutional neural network is superior to that of deep neural network. This is also the reason why the two kinds of neural networks are used at the same time in this experiment in order to compare the effect of the two networks in this experiment. In such a case, for the third model we use the combination of the CNN&amp;DNN to check the prediction performances when the two models are jointed. The data are processed by the CNN model first, and then the results obtained by the CNN model are input into the DNN model to obtain the final prediction.</p><p>The fourth model is a classical LR model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yu &amp; Yao, 2017)</ref> used in machine learning. Linear regression model is the simplest and most practical prediction model in machine learning. Its principle is based on the correlation between the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y, which can establish the linear regression equation of X and Y to predict the result.</p><p>The fifth model is the LightGBM ensemble model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kadiyala &amp; Kumar, 2018)</ref>. LightGBM is based on the classic decision tree model, which was proposed by Microsoft. The main purpose of LightGBM is to solve the problem of the slow speed of decision trees when facing large amounts of data. As the name suggests, LightGBM is a lightweight gradient elevator. Compared with XGBoost model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>, it has the characteristics of fast training speed and low memory consumption, which is nearly 10 times faster than XGBoost and only uses about 1/6 as much memory as XGBoost. The lightGBM has improved the accuracy as well. The working principle of LightGBM is to discrete continuous floating-point features into k discrete values and construct histogram of width k. The training data are traversed to calculate the cumulative statistics of each discrete value in the histogram. In the feature selections, it only needs to traverse to find the optimal segmentation point according to the discrete value of the histogram.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental Results in Earth's Outer Radiation Belt</head><p>In order to show the overall prediction effect of above models, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> gives both observational and predicted electron differential fluxes along the electron energy during a geomagnetic storm from 26 March 2017 to 29 March 2017. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> shows the variations of DST index with 1 hour resolution and AE index with 1 minute resolution from Wind satellite observation. According to the peaks or troughs of DST and AE parameters, we then select 12 time points (marked by the red vertical lines) during this period to check the predictions of five models on the electron differential flux. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>-2m present the comparisons between observational data (dotted line) and five predictions from DNN (purple), CNN (yellow), CNN&amp;DNN (green), LR (pink) and LightGBM ensemble (blue) models, respectively, for these 12 time points. All 20 energy levels are included and the prediction time goes for N = 60 time steps (10 min). After normalized restoration and log processing, the data are displayed in the graphs. Generally, the prediction effects of these models are good. Every model can present effective short-time forecast for the electron differential flux. Both DST and AE indexes have little influence on the prediction results. However, it can be seen that, in several energy channel of few cases, some models have large deviations from the predicted value. But the LightGBM ensemble model still has smallest deviations and presents best performances.</p><p>It should be noted that since the flux value of the predicted energy level of some models is less than zero, there is no corresponding value in the figure after it is deleted in the log procession. We found that this situation will not occur in the LightGBM ensemble model, which proves the superiority of LightGBM ensemble model again.</p><p>When we detailedly compare the differences between the real observations and the prediction results, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the time-dependent predictions of two selected energy channels (53.8 and 2651 keV) based on five models during August 04 ∼17, 2017, where the panels from top to bottom are outcomes of LightGBM ensemble, LR, CNN&amp;DNN, CNN, and DNN models, respectively. Here the electron differential fluxes have been normalized where the blue line represents the real observational data, the red line represents the predicted flux by each model, and the black dotted line represents the case when the normalized flux equals to zero. It can be clearly seen that, the predicted fluxes are significantly consistent with the real data. Although the predicted results for those peaks of electron flux are slightly smaller than the true observations, all five models can still achieve very good forecasting effects according to the time variation. Moreover, it should be noted that, except for the LightGBM ensemble model, the other four models may obtain several negative values. The reason is that the true electron flux is too small in the entire energy level, and after normalization, its value is very close to the critical value zero. Therefore, there may be cross-border phenomenon in the process of prediction, that is, it is less than zero. We also give the similar prediction results of other four energy channels in the Supporting Information S1 to show more cases.</p><p>Furthermore, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> presents the detailed comparisons of prediction results with all observed flux data at 231.8 keV energy channel for different time step when N = 120. The rows from top to bottom are results from the LightGBM ensemble, LR, CNN&amp;DNN, CNN, and DNN models respectively, while the columns from left to right give the predictions at the 1st (10th second), 30th (5th minute), 60th (10th minute), 90th (15th minute) and 120th (20th minute) time step, respectively. Here the x-axis is the normalized true observation flux, the y-axis is the normalized prediction value, and the red line is the line of y = x. The correlation coefficient (CC) is calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = ∑ 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖=1 ( 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 − X𝑋) ( 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 − Ȳ𝑌 ) √ ∑ 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖=1 ( 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 − X𝑋) 2 √ ∑ 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖=1 ( 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 − Ȳ𝑌 ) 2 , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>which can determine whether two data sets are on the same line or measure the linear relationship between two distance variables. Generally, if the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient is larger, the predicted electron flux is much closer to the observed data. On the other hand, the root mean square error (RMSE) is also used here to show the differences between the predicted value and the observed values in these experiments,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = √ ∑ 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖=1 (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖) 2 𝑛𝑛 .</formula><p>(2) it can be seen that, at 231.8 keV, most of data points are still close to the red line, especially for those lower electron differential fluxes. All Pearson correlation coefficients are larger than 0.91 and corresponding RMSE values are smaller than 0.05. It proves that all five models can obtain good forecasting performances. On the other hand, if we check the results from left to right for each model, the predicted electron flux data from all five machine learning models deviate from the red line more and more when the prediction time step is extended from 1st to 120th, which has also been confirmed by both the increase of CC value and the decrease of RMSE value. It suggests that the forecasting performance becomes worse when the prediction time step grows up, and is consistent with the general concept of artificial intelligence applications. Moreover, if we compare the model results from top to bottom, the prediction of LR model is the best at the beginning, while the CNN&amp;DNN model has slightly poor effect. DNN model has the most scattered points and its performance should be the worst. Finally, the LightGBM ensemble model does combine the advantages of other models and can achieve the best performance.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the variations of the accumulated RMSE value of the prediction data from all 20 energy channels depending on the prediction time step, for different prediction period, says N = 45 (7.5 min), 60 (10 min), 90 (15 min) and 120 (20 min) time steps. The colors correspond to the LightGBM (blue), LR (pink), CNN&amp;DNN On the other hand, as for the differences of the prediction results at different energy channels, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> gives the variations of the accumulated RMSE value of the prediction data depending on the electron energy for those five models, where the same colors are used to represent the models like Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. It can be noted that all five models have similar fluctuations in prediction performance but the LightGBM ensemble model generally has the best forecasting results. When the total prediction time increases, the RMSE of all energy level also increases, which is consistent with Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4 and 5</ref>. <ref type="bibr">However, For 79.8, 464.4, 593, 741.6, 901.8, 1701, 2275, and</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>   prediction effect is small. It means that the machine learning forecast have somehow worse effects at medium or high electron energies.</p><p>In order to compare the overall prediction effect of these five models, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> presents the sum of RMSE from all prediction period and energy channels corresponding to each model, when N = 45 (7.5 min), 60 (10 min), 90 (15 min) and 120 (20 min) time steps. It is very obvious that the overall effects of five models are followed by DNN &lt; CNN &lt; CNN&amp;DNN &lt; LR &lt; Ensemble. The accumulated RMSE values from five models are very close when the total prediction period is short, like N = 45, which means each model can achieve relatively good performance for a very short-time prediction period. However, as the prediction period increases, the performances of those models have distinct differences. The combination of CNN and DNN (CNN&amp;DNN) will obtain smaller RMSE than independent DNN or CNN model. The LightGBM ensemble model, which integrated the effects of the other four models, performs the best result.</p><p>Moreover, it should be noted that the above experiments have not included any solar wind or geomagnetic activity conditions as parameter inputs for our machine leaning models since we only consider a very short-time electron flux prediction. Therefore, we use two geomagnetic activity indices (AE and SYM-H, as indicators of the magnetospheric response to solar wind conditions) as additional input parameters to further compare the prediction effects with and without the external magnetospheric environmental variations. When we do normalization processing for the electron fluxes, we also normalized the AE and SYM-H parameters during the data processing phase. Then we fed the normalized AE and SYM-H values, along with the normalized flux and position information, into the ensemble model as training parameters. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> presents the differences of the accumulated RMSE values obtained from the LightGBM ensemble model with and without geomagnetic indices, for the different prediction time-scale N = 90, 180, 240, and 360 time steps (corresponding to 15 ∼ 60 min). The AE and SYM-H indices are chosen from 1 hr to 24 hr ahead. The x-axis represents the prediction time. The y-axis represents the RMSE differences that the predicted RMSE with geomagnetic parameters minus those without geomagnetic parameters. It can be clearly seen that, at the beginning of four different prediction time-scales, the prediction effects by adding AE and SYM-H parameters are worse than those without two geomagnetic activity conditions (indicated by the of positive values), which clearly means that the short-time prediction of electron differential fluxes can be valid and better without external geomagnetic parameters. However, when the time step increases, the performance of the ensemble model with these two geomagnetic parameters gradually improves over the original model (indicated by the region of negative values). The impacts of AE and SYM-H on the ensemble model will become more significant. When the time step goes to around 500 time steps (almost 80-90 min), the external magnetospheric conditions should be definitely added, which gives us the limit of the short-time prediction. Based on our further experiments, the L and MLT from 30 input samples will not change much. However, when the prediction time scale increases, the L value of predicted samples can reach 1 L-shell and the difference of MLT can be 2 hr. In such a case, the orbit of RBSP-A will be changed a lot so that the short-time flux prediction without the geomagnetic indices or solar wind parameters will be invalid. Furthermore, for the short-time prediction, we think that the 30 samples as the model inputs already included the impact of current AE or SYM-H. At this moment, we can ignore these impact for a very short period. Finally, we believe that the short-time prediction only works during several minutes to 15 min (before the green shadows). When the prediction time-scale goes to around 500 time steps (almost 80-90 min), the external magnetospheric conditions should be definitely added, which gives us the limit of the short-time prediction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Further Experiments on Saturn</head><p>Based on the above experiments, a more ideal short-time prediction of electron differential flux can be achieved without adding solar wind or geomagnetic activity parameters in the Earth's outer radiation belt, which indicates that the effects of the external conditions will not affect the short-time prediction. Since those solar wind or geomagnetic conditions are not easy to measure in other planets, such as Saturn, and Cassini spacecraft does not have instruments specifically designed to measure Saturn's solar wind parameters, the extrapolated data can produce unexpected errors once putting into machine learning models. Therefore, we further apply these five machine learning models in the short-time prediction of Saturn's electron flux based on local L, MLT, and MLAT parameters to provide a planetary application.</p><p>Similarly with RBSP-A satellite, Cassini spacecraft also measured multiple channels of electron differential fluxes, and here we used the channels C0-C7 and E0-E4, which cover 18-4950 keV. The time period is from 1 July 2004 to 15 September 2017. In order to perform our algorithms mainly in the Saturn's inner magnetosphere, we selected the electron flux data based on two conditions: (a) The L-shell of all observed data one should be within 20 R S (Saturn's radius); (b) The corresponding MLAT value should be within ±15°. These two limitation can make sure that all electron flux data are mainly from the Saturn's inner magnetosphere and close to the equatorial plane. Therefore, the data sampling method will follow the exactly same rules as those used on the RBSP-A, except that the accuracy of the electron flux at Saturn is 1 minute. (It will correspond to the changes of the prediction time scale: from N = 45 to N = 120). In Saturn's experiments, the previous DNN, CNN, CNN&amp;DNN, LR, and LightGBM ensemble model are still used. It should be noted that, due to the large difference between different channels, all Saturn's electron flux data will be normalized by Flux norm = log 10 (Flux ori + 5) in order to facilitate faster convergence for all of above models, where Flux ori is the original flux data and Flux norm is the normalized data that put into the prediction model. bottom, the prediction models are LightGBM ensemble, LR model, CNN&amp;DNN, CNN, and DNN model, respectively. It is very obvious that all five models can still achieve very good prediction performances, which is the same as those experiments in the Earth. The peak value of the predicted flux value is also slightly smaller than the peak value of the observed data. Because of the different normalization formula, the cross-border phenomenon is not obvious here.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, for the first time, we present a short-time prediction for the electron differential flux based on five machine learning models, including the DNN, the CNN, the combination of CNN and DNN (CNN&amp;DNN), the LR, and the LightGBM. In order to quickly obtain the prediction results, we only considered the local parameters, like L, MLT, MLAT, and the observed electron flux data at observed 30 data samples (nearly 5 min on Earth) to predict electron flux for next 45, 60, 90, and 120 time steps, which correspond to 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 min on Earth, respectively. Based on the observed data of all 20 energy levels (from 31.5 to 4216 keV) from the MagEIS instru- In such a case, it can be concluded that the short-time prediction of electron flux from our machine learning algorithms can reach a satisfactory effect by only using the historical flux data and location information. The impact of the solar wind parameter or geomagnetic activity conditions can also be ignored for a very short-time prediction. Furthermore, we applied this method to Saturn's electron flux prediction and the prediction performances of all models are still similar with those from the Earth. The LightGBM ensemble model finally obtains the best prediction result.</p><p>It should be noted that a long-time deep learning prediction of the planetary space weather usually requires a lot of real-time or historical observation data for external environment parameters. It is still hard to collect most of those data from limited satellite missions, which may dramatically affect current artificial intelligence applications in deep space explorations. Our short-time electron flux prediction gives a new insight in the space weather applications based on machine learning, which will be critical for practical applications to the instrument designs and system operations of new scientific satellites in the space radiation environment.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Visualization:</head><label></label><figDesc>Rongxin Tang, Yuhao Tao, Jiahao Li, Zhou Chen, Haimeng Li Writing -original draft: Rongxin Tang, Yuhao Tao, Jiahao Li, Zhou Chen Writing -review &amp; editing: Rongxin Tang, Zhou Chen</figDesc></figure>

LR model still performs well in Saturn and CNN&amp;DNN model performs slightly worse than LR model. The LightGBM ensemble model is also the best among the five models.Figures 11 and 12 also give the statistical results of the accumulated RMSE value for different prediction time scale and different energy channels, as the same format with Figures5 and 6. It can be seen from both two figures that the LightGBM ensemble model and LR model have very similar prediction performances, and the CNN model and CNN&amp;DNN model are very close. From the two figures, we can be certain that the RMSE of all models grows as the time scale increases. But the LightGBM ensemble model still have the best effect. Finally, as shown in Figure13, we give the total accumulated RMSE values from five machine learning models based on different prediction time scale. The error of prediction results of those models are followed by DNN &gt; CNN &gt; CNN&amp;DNN &gt; LR &gt; LightGBM, which are roughly the same as those on Earth. The only difference is that the CNN&amp;DNN model does not show better results than the CNN model when the prediction time is extended. However, the LightGBM ensemble model also performs best effect among the five prediction models. It significantly proves that the short-time electron flux prediction can still work in the deep space explorations.</figDesc><table /></figure>
