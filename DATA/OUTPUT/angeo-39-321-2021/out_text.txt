Abstract. Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are especially visible in the summertime when there is an advection
of warm maritime air from the west. Advection of air masses
is enriched by water vapour, the source of which can be found
over the Mediterranean Sea. In propitious atmospheric conditions, and thus significant convection, atmospheric instability or strong vertical thermal gradient leads to the development of strong thunderstorm systems. In this paper, we discuss one case of MCSs, which generated a significant amount
of +CG (cloud-to-ground), —CG and intracloud (IC) discharges. We have focused on the ELF (extremely low frequency; < 1 kHz) electromagnetic field measurements, since
they allow us to compute the charge moments of atmospheric
discharges. Identification of the MCSs is a complex process,
due to many variables which have to be taken into account.
For our research, we took into consideration a few tools, such
as cloud reflectivity, atmospheric soundings and data provided by PERUN (Polish system of the discharge localisation system), which operates in a very high frequency (VHF)
range (113.5—114.5 MHz). Combining the above-described
measurement systems and tools, we identified a MCS which
occurred in Poland on 23 July 2009. Furthermore, it fulfilled
our requirements since the thunderstorm crossed the path of
the DEMETER (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions
Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) overpass.

1 Introduction

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are enormous cloud
structures known as one of the strongest discharge generators
in the world (Bonner, 1968; Banta et al., 2002; Houze, 2014).
In the past, many have focused on the topic of MCSs activity (e.g. Price, 2002; Cummer, 2004). In our previous work
(Martynski et al., 2018), we analysed a supercell that occurred over Poland. In this paper, our main goal is to combine
measurements from two autonomous systems, namely the
ELF (extremely low frequency) Hylaty station and DEMETER (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted
from Earthquake Regions) satellite that measures ELF and
VLF (very low frequency) fields. Additionally, we used PERUN (Polish system of the discharge localisation system) to
track the storm cells and to scrutinise individual lightning
discharges.

To conduct the analysis, we have designated one event of
the MCS which occurred on 23 July 2009. The selection of
this specific MCS was not random; we have been looking
for the most favourable conditions to conduct the research
and, hence, significant convection, atmospheric instability or
strong vertical thermal gradient. Since we focused on Poland,
we had access to data provided by the Polish meteorological service, IMGW-PIB (Institute of Meteorology and Water
Management — National Research Institute). The most crucial part in the search for MCSs was to scrutinise DEME

TER overpasses in order to distinguish periods in which it
was over Poland.

2 Detection of electromagnetic signals generated by
atmospheric discharges

Ground-based measurements were conducted by the Hylaty
ELF (extremely low frequency) station (Kulak et al., 2014)
localised in the Bieszczady Mountains in Poland. The station measures the electromagnetic field in the ELF range. We
used a receiver that operates in 0.03—55 Hz frequency range
and uses two orthogonal magnetic antennas, one aligned
north-south and the second aligned east-west. Based on
these measurements, inverted solutions developed within our
team were used, which support computation of the charge
moments of cloud-to-ground (CG) discharges (Kulak et al.,
2010). This method requires two parameters, where one is
the distance between the discharge and the receiver and the
second is the amplitude of the recorded impulse. The MCS
was located approximately 350 to 450km from the station
and was facing northeast.

DEMETER operated until December 2010 and had a Sunsynchronous orbit. The ELF/VLF range for the electric and
magnetic fields is from the Cartesian components of the static
(DC) up to 20 kHz. There are two scientific modes. The first
iS a survey mode, with the spectra of one electric and one
magnetic component used in the on-board computing up to
20 kHz. The time resolution for the spectra in this case is
about 2s and frequency resolution about 19 Hz. The second
one is a burst mode, where, in addition to the on-board computed spectra, waveforms of three electric and three magnetic
field components are recorded with sampling up to 2.5 kHz.
During the burst mode, the waveforms of the six components
of electromagnetic field were registered with 2550 Hz sampling rate. It allows us to perform a spectral analysis in the
range up to 1250 Hz with a much higher time and frequency
resolution (0.4 ms and 0.8 mHz; Parrot et al., 2006; Berthelier et al., 2006). Since the burst mode is used occasionally,
we had to distinguish periods where the measurements corresponded with thunderstorms. As mentioned above, the satellite allows us to measure signals in VLF and ELF ranges,
which aids in the search of these relations (Parrot et al., 2008,
2013; Blecki et al., 2016) and, thus, differences and variations in the ionosphere and magnetosphere caused by thunderstorm activity (Berthelier et al., 2006).

3 Results

From the southwest, Poland was covered by a warm tropical
air masses. Their advection over colder polar maritime air
caused the occurrence of a significant thermal contrast between western and eastern Europe. For instance, the temperature difference in Benelux and eastern Germany and Poland
was larger than 15°C. Furthermore, due to temperature dis

crepancies in tropospheric layers, a jet stream occurred in
the middle troposphere (700 hPa), with the airflow around
15—25m per second. Thus, conditions were favourable for
wind shear to occur, which 1s vital for thunderstorm development. Over southern Sweden, a local low that caused flow of
the cold front from the western Europe is noticeable. Around
19:00 UTC (universal coordinated time) over Lower Silesia
(Polish voivodeship or administrative division), a derecho
had occurred, which is well known for strong wind gusts
often exceeding 40m per second. The thunderstorm’s path
covered an area of 1000 km in length, and the width varied
between 50 and 200km. Lastly, high thermodynamic instability lead to the updraughts. The discussed example of MCS
is qualified as derecho, due to the propitious synoptic conditions and the destruction it caused (Evans and Doswell,
2001).

Vertical wind shears support the separation of the updraughts from downdraughts; moreover, they support processes that are responsible for development of the multicellular thunderstorms. The discussed airflow in the middle troposphere allowed the whole system to move with relatively
high velocity. The convergence in the lower troposphere let
the bow echo form, which manifested as a squall line. Last,
but not least, another significant condition for MCS development is the advection of the cold air mass from the western
regions of Europe. Thermodynamic conditions, which appeared over southwestern Poland, additionally confirm the
development of the strong convective phenomena. The data
from atmospheric soundings show a high temperature level
at the ground layer (over 30°C), with the dew tempera

ture at 22°C. A strong airflow from the west is visible in
the whole troposphere. Thermodynamic indicators, such as
CAPE (convective available potential energy), with 2500 J
per kilogram, or CIN (convective inhibition), with —100J per
kilogram, indicate strong convective processes. A significant
drying of air appears, and then a dry adiabatic gradient is noticeable in the middle troposphere. A small inversion layer
(CIN) favours the gathering of the energy beneath it. When
convection is strong enough, it is possible to break through
the inversion, which directly leads to the intensification of
the convection processes. Then the tropopause is penetrated
by the convection, and an overshooting top may appear in the
lower parts of the stratosphere (Fig. 1). Apart from the discussed thermodynamic parameters, SBCAPE (surface-based
convective available potential energy) is significant. The parameter indicates the convection in the surface layer; in this
case it exceeded 2500 J per kilogram. Furthermore, DCAPE
(downward convective available potential energy) 1s available, which is the potential of downdraughts at 1077J per
kilogram. The wind shear parameter, in 0-6 km, was higher
than 20 m per second, whereas, in 0-3 km, the parameter was
equal to 13m per second. A significant development of the
thunderstorm phenomenon is visible by the measurements of
the cloud reflectivity. In many parts of the MCSs, a level that
exceeds 50 dBZ is distinguishable, indicating strong convec

tive processes, which supplied cloud development at a level
higher than 15 km over the ground level.

Strong atmospheric discharges stem from significant MCS
development. In the period of the highest thunderstorm activity, 24 +CG (cloud-to-ground), 322 —CG and 2836 IC (intracloud) discharges were detected (Fig. 2). Additionally, we
provide data for other periods where a significant amount of
discharges occurred (Table 1), which indicates an enormous
extent of IC discharges. The intensification of the discharges
with highest wind gusts is visible in the front parts of MCSs.

During the analysis of the DEMETER data for the whole
lifespan of the discussed MCSs, we have encountered a signature of a whistler, a characteristic type of wave that occurs in VLF frequency range. The whistlers are cold plasma
waves in the frequency range from the ion cyclotron up to the

electron plasma frequency or electron cyclotron frequency.
These waves are common in space around the Earth and may
be registered in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere by
the satellite on-board receivers and by the ground-based systems. The characteristic shape of a whistler’s spectrum, with
falling frequency in time, is a result of its dispersion feature
and propagation. The group velocity is greater for waves with
higher frequencies than for lower ones. The whistlers propagate along magnetic field lines from the site of the thunderstorm. The arrival of the lower frequency waves is delayed
in relation to higher frequency (Helliwell, 1965; Hayakawa,
1995).

Figure 3 presents a whistler that has been detected by
the DEMETER overpass, which was 287km away from
the causative lightning stroke. Its precise location was
provided by PERUN. During that time, an impulse was
caught by ground-based systems, which detected an impulse
slightly ahead of the satellite; PERUN detected a signal at
20:05:49.13 and classified it as a +CG, with the maximum
current of 24kA. Hylaty measurements distinguish an impulse at 20:05:49.14, with an amplitude 220 pT and a charge
moment of 103 C per kilometre. The satellite registered a signal at 20:05:49.23, with an electric field 1200 uV per metre;
the magnetic field is omitted due to high noise. The whole period of MCS activity has been presented in Fig. 4. Data presented in the figure represent a distribution of the charge moments, which were computed from data collected by the Hylaty ELF station. As a result, only lightning with the charge
moment above 23C per kilometre is included in our analysis The highest charge moment during MCS lifespan was
328.9 C per kilometre. The total amount of +CG discharges,
which occurred, was 1073. The average value of charge moment is 42.5 C per kilometre.

4 Summary

In this paper, we focused on a specific type of thunderstorm,
an MCS classified as a derecho, which is not frequent in Europe and may be disastrous for overpassed areas. It is known
mostly for the intense wind gusts and small amount of discharges. Comparing results from our previous paper about
supercell activity (Martynski et al., 2018), we can conclude
that the supercell in the most active hour generated an almost equal amount of discharge to the MCS case during its
whole life cycle. That indicates that the supercell generated
at least two times more discharge than MCSs, although the
strongest strokes are still produced by the huge cloud clusters. This means that MCSs are more developed storm cells,
although they are unable to generate multiple strong discharges. This might be due to the fact that they cover larger
areas compared to supercells, which have a more organised
and condensed structure, allowing heat and storm-like processes to develop as a stronger singular thunderstorm. Similar results to ours have been obtained by Cummer (2004),

https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-321-2021

who stated that MCSs on high plains in the USA generated,
in 1h, roughly 312 +CG strokes, and the mean charge moment was equal to 36.8C per kilometre. In this study, we
also presented a whistler that was registered by DEMETER
during its overpass of the MCSs. This shows the potential of
combined ground-based and satellite studies.
