Abstract

Heat transport in the solar corona and wind is still a major unsolved astrophysical problem. Because of the key role
played by electrons, the electron density and temperature(s) are important prerequisites for understanding these
plasmas. We present such in situ measurements along the two first solar encounters of the Parker Solar Probe,
between 0.5 and 0.17 au from the Sun, revealing different states of the emerging solar wind near the solar activity
minimum. These preliminary results are obtained from a simplified analysis of the plasma quasi-thermal noise
(QTN) spectrum measured by the Radio Frequency Spectrometer (FIELDS). The local electron density is deduced
from the tracking of the plasma line, which enables accurate measurements, independent of calibrations and
spacecraft perturbations, whereas the temperatures of the thermal and suprathermal components of the velocity
distribution, as well as the average kinetic temperature, are deduced from the shape of the plasma line. The
temperature of the weakly collisional thermal population, similar for both encounters, decreases with the distance
as R-°-"*, which is much slower than adiabatic. In contrast, the temperature of the nearly collisionless suprathermal
population exhibits a virtually flat radial variation. The 7s resolution of the density measurements enables us to
deduce the low-frequency spectrum of compressive fluctuations around perihelion, varying as f'*. This is the first
time that QTN spectroscopy is implemented with an electric antenna length not exceeding the plasma Debye
length. As PSP will approach the Sun, the decrease in the Debye length is expected to considerably improve the
accuracy of the temperature measurements.

1. Introduction

The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft (Fox et al. 2016),
launched on 2018 August 12, is orbiting the Sun on highly
elliptical trajectories of perihelion gradually decreasing from
35.7 solar radii (Re) to the closest approach of 9.86 Ro from
the center of the Sun, via Venus gravity assists. The present
paper deals with the two first encounters that took place in 2018
October-November (E01) and 2019 March—April (E02), close
to the heliographic equator, with perihelions of 0.17 au
(35.7 Ro), therefore largely extending inward the Helios
exploration. The trajectory crossed several times the heliospheric current sheet, thus revealing different types of wind and
dynamic structures (Bale et al. 2019). During the so-called
encounter phases of the trajectory, inward of 0.25 au (54 Ro),
all instruments record data at a high rate (7 s cadence). In order
to increase the radial extension of the results, we have also
analyzed data farther away from the Sun, up to about 100 Ro
(0.46 au), despite the reduced rate (56s cadence).

Our results are based on power spectra acquired by the lowfrequency receiver (LFR) of the Radio Frequency Spectrometer
(RES), which is a part of the FIELDS instrument suite on PSP

(Bale et al. 2016). The RFS instrument (Pulupa et al. 2017) is a
two-channel receiver and spectrometer, at the terminals of four
2m monopole electric antennas mounted near the front of the
spacecraft close to the extremities of the heat shield diagonals,
so that the two corresponding linear dipoles are 7 m tip-to-tip in
length and are perpendicular to the axis of the spacecraft. The
present preliminary results are based on data from only one
dipole (V;—-V>). The LFR (10.5 kHz—1.7 MHz) spectra are
analyzed with the technique of quasi-thermal noise (QTN)
spectroscopy, which yields the electron density and the
temperatures of the thermal (core) and suprathermal components of the velocity distribution, as well as the total kinetic
temperature (e.g., Meyer-Vernet et al. 2017 and references
therein).

The radial temperature profiles have never been measured in situ
inward of 0.3 au. Helios I and []—from 0.3 to 1 au—and Ulysses
—from about | to 4 au—found approximate power-law decreases
with the distance of indices typically between —0.3 and —0.9 for
the thermal core, with a flatter gradient for fast streams (Sittler &
Scudder 1980; Pilipp et al. 1990; Phillips et al. 1995a; Issautier
et al. 1998, 1999a; Maksimovic et al. 2000). The suprathermal
THE ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES, 246:44 (11pp), 2020 February

part, which includes a beaming component aligned to the magnetic
field (also known as Strahl), was previously found to represent
A%-10% of the distribution (McComas et al. 1992; Stverdk et al.
2009) and was found to have a temperature decreasing weakly
with the distance (Phillips et al. 1995b; Pierrard et al. 2016).

Despite decades of study, the turbulence in the solar wind is
still not fully understood, especially the role of compressive
fluctuations in the transport of energy in a weakly collisional
plasma. A question of considerable importance is the relationship between the small-scale structure associated with density
fluctuations and large-scale plasma properties (Alexandrova
et al. 2013; Lacombe et al. 2014; Lion et al. 2016). The
accurate electron density samples obtained from QTN on PSP
at perihelion enable us to study these compressive fluctuations
much closer to the Sun than previously possible (Celnikier
et al. 1983: Marsch & Tu 1990; Safrankova et all. 2015).

This paper is organized as follow. Section 2 recalls the main
properties of QTN under PSP conditions and gives complete
radio spectrograms for both solar encounters. Section 3
presents the methods to deduce the electron density and
temperatures with some analytical approximations. Section 4
shows the radial variations of the electron thermal and
suprathermal temperatures during the two first extended
encounters and discusses the results and produces statistics.
Section 5 uses the electron density data sets around 35.7 Ro to
deduce the low-frequency spectrum of compressive fluctuations. Final remarks as conclusions are given in Section 6.

2. QTN Spectroscopy

Plasma particle properties in space are classically measured
in situ by particle analyzers, pioneered in the solar wind by the
“solar plasma experiment” on board Mariner 2 that provided
(more than half a century ago; Neugebauer & Snyder 1962;
Neugebauer 1997) the ultimate proof that this supersonic
wind was more than a mere theoretician’s dream (Parker
1958, 2001).

In contrast, the technique of QTN spectroscopy measures
particles via electrostatic fields, exploiting the strong coupling
between plasma particles and fields (Sitenko 1967). Introduced
on board the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3 (MeyerVernet 1979) and pioneered to measure the cold (Meyer-Vernet
et al. 1986a) and hot (Meyer-Vernet et al. 1986b) electrons in
the tail of a comet, this technique uses the power spectrum of
the voltage induced on an electric antenna by the particle quasithermal motions, measured by a radio receiver connected to an
electric antenna. The signature of the electrons is a line at the
electron plasma frequency, f,, which reveals the total electron
density, n x fi whereas the shape of the line reveals the
electron kinetic temperature, as well as its thermal (core) and
suprathermal components (Meyer-Vernet et al. 2017 and
references therein).

The f, plasma line is produced by Langmuir waves induced
by the particle quasi-thermal motions. Since the Langmuir
wavelength, A;, exceeds the ambient Debye length, Lp, the
detection requires an electric antenna of a length exceeding Lp.
However, electrons interact with waves of a phase speed equal
to their proper speed, and since Az; — oo as the frequency
f— f,, So does the Langmuir wave phase speed. Hence,
suprathermal electrons can increase considerably the spectral
density at f,, producing a peak of amplitude characteristic of
them (Meyer-Vernet & Perche 1989). On the other hand, the
electrons passing by the antenna closer than Lp induce transient

Moncuquet et al.

voltages of duration 1/f,, which thus produce a flat spectrum
for f <f,, characteristic of the thermal core of the electron
velocity distribution. Furthermore, the high-frequency spectrum is proportional to the total electron pressure.

Because Ay, — co as f > f,, the technique is equivalent to a
detector of a large cross section—much larger than that of
conventional spaceborne detectors—and it is relatively immune
to spacecraft perturbations, photoelectrons, and charging
effects (Meyer-Vernet et al. 1998). For these reasons, QTN
spectroscopy is complementary to particle analyzers, serving
routinely to calibrate them (e.g., Maksimovic et al. 1995;
Issautier et al. 2001; Salem et al. 2001), and has been and will
be implemented on a number of spacecraft in various
environments (see, e.g., Moncuquet et al. 2009).

These properties are especially suitable on PSP because near
the Sun, the 2m electric antennas will be adequately longer
than Lp, whereas the expected complex environment of the
spacecraft (Ergun et al. 2010) will require a technique immune
to spacecraft perturbations in order to measure the genuine
plasma particle properties. However, the perihelion of the first
PSP orbits, lying outward of 35Ro, is not close enough to the
Sun for the Debye length to be smaller than the antenna length,
which was unfortunately restricted by spacecraft safety
considerations. Nevertheless, the suprathermal electrons, of a
speed close to the phase speed of Langmuir waves near /f,,
enables the plasma line to emerge (Figure 1).

3. Deducing the Electron Density and Temperatures

The electron density and temperatures are usually obtained
from the QTN technique by assuming a model for the velocity
distribution, calculating the theoretical QTN power spectral
density, and deducing the parameters of the model by fitting the
theory to the observations (e.g., Issautier et al. 1998). However,
for the present preliminary results, we used a simpler method,
based on simplified estimates of the relevant parts of the
spectrum, similar to the method used on Cassini in Saturn’s
magnetosphere (Moncuquet et al. 2005; Schippers et al. 2013);
albeit at Saturn, the Debye length was short compared to the
antenna length, whereas the opposite is true for these two first
encounters (see Figure 2). Instead of using the whole spectra in
the LFR-RFS frequency range with the model fitting, we
determine the electron density from the frequency of the
detected peak and the temperatures of thermal and suprathermal
components of the electron distribution from the power level
reached at the peak and the minimum level below the peak.

3.1. Electron Density

First of all, the local electron density is deduced from the
tracking of the plasma line at f, (see an example in Figure 7),
with elimination of questionable measurements . Miscellaneous
algorithms may be used for tracking the plasma line from the
raw power spectrum at the inputs of the receiver, without any
calibration, and a software to do so is implemented in RFS/
FIELDS (Pulupa et al. 2017). In the present study, we use
instead the algorithm developed for the Spectroscopie Ondes &
Bruit Electrostatique Thermique radio receiver (Moncuquet
et al. 2006; Kasaba et al. 2019) on the BepiColombo mission
(European Space Agency & Japan Aerospace eXploration
Agency (ESA-JAXA)), which is mainly based on detecting the
steepest growth rate in each raw spectrum. This algorithm
(somewhat improved for LFR—RSF) is efficient; for example,

solar encounters, showing the plasma quasi-thermal noise on which the plasma line at f, emerges clearly (cyan line varying between 80 and 200 kHz).

during the high-rate data period in the first encounter (E01), the
peak is detected in 95% of the available spectra (~130,000
spectra). The main improvement of the algorithm was to
withdraw the false positives (for example, with type III bursts
or strong interferences). We used the fact that a supposedly
high f, must provide a relative high peak level if it is bona-fide
QTN (since the peak behaves roughly as Vf see Equation (2)
below); otherwise, the detection is withdrawn. This represents
about 2% of the initial selection (3% for the second encounter,
likely because of the numerous type III bursts and the dilute
wind around perihelion).

The deduced electron density is plotted (black dots) on
Figure 2. Because they stem from a detection algorithm
(instead of a model fitting), these results are stepped since
LFR-RFS uses only 64 pseudo-logarithmically spaced frequencies in the range of 10 kHz—1.7 MHz. As a consequence,
the lowest densities (say < 100cm™~”) are more stepped than
the higher ones, with larger error bars.

3.2. Electron Temperatures

1. The temperature, T., of the thermal component of the
velocity distribution, assumed to be Maxwellian, is then
deduced from the yor spectral density just below Ip»
hereafter noted as V2., (see Figure 7). This quantity is
essentially the plateau QTN spectrum, hereafter noted as V6,
and is produced by electrons passing around the antennas
closer than Lp on which the effect of the separation of the
antenna arms is discussed in the Appendix A. To calculate
Vo at the receiver inputs, one must take into account
the antenna gain calculated from the load/stray capacitance
and the impedance of the antenna modified by the plasma.
The QTN plateau is then given as a function of the core
temperature, 7T., and the Debye length, Lp, by (from
Moncuguet et al. 2005)

af 2 T. 00

m/2e9(1 + Cp /CaY Cp /Ca)? [eL2 + 1P + If

in S.I. units, Vo being in V2/Hz. Here, F(KL) is the PSP
wire antenna response (detailed in Appendix A), with L as
the single wire length (L ~ 2m); Cy = mé9L/ In(Lp /a) is
an approximation of the dipole antenna capacitance at low
frequencies, with a as the wire radius (a ~ 1.5mm); and
Cz is the (dipole) stray capacitance (~18pF). Two

(generally minor) contributions must be added to this
plateau QTN: the shot noise, V3,,,, produced by the currents
flowing between the antennas and the plasma, possibly
mitigated/enhanced by the antenna biasing, and the
Doppler-shifted protons, QTN Ve. Finally, we use an
iterative method to solve the implicit Equation (1) and

deduce T.. from the observable V2... , taking into account at

each step some approximations of Vj, and Ve (see
Appendix B).

The deduced core temperature, 7, during the first (top)
and second (bottom) extended solar encounters is plotted in
blue in Figure 2. The vertical dashed lines indicate the
beginning and end of the high-rate data (7s). The vertical
dotted lines indicate a period when the data are perturbed
by biasing or a change in modes; this is unfortunate
because this day is one of the rare periods of high wind
speed in EO1, therefore preventing us from measuring the
thermal electron properties in high speed wind.

. The temperature of the suprathermal eoniparient of the

velocity distribution is obtained using the ratio V2, /Viin
between the peak level and the level V2., (see Figure 7),
and is, therefore, independent of calibration or biasing
that affect the two levels in the same way. Statistically,
this ratio is well centered with regular variance. Modeling
the suprathermal electrons by a Kappa distribution (which
includes the Maxwellian case k — co), the peak level
may be estimated using Equations (59)—(60) from MeyerVernet et al. (2017; with range of validity therein,
including the case Lp >L). We deduce the following
estimate for the temperature 7; of the suprathermal
electrons:

the plasma frequency, f,; T is the electron kinetic
temperature, A ~ 7. /T ./2Af /3f, ; and Fo is the value
of the integral in Equation (1) (also detailed in
Appendix A).

Given the uncertainties on the whole electron
velocity distribution and the approximations made in
our QTN modeling, which presently does not take into
account the anisotropy of the Strahl, we will only exploit

the centered estimator V2, /V2., obtained from the data,

without trying to match a value of kappa. In other words,

we deduce a proxy 7; of the temperature of the

suprathermal component of the distribution assuming

merely J, x V2, /V2.,, and using Equation (2) to
dimensionate, with & = 5. These temperatures are plotted
in gold at the bottom of Figure 2 for the first (top) and
second (bottom) extended solar encounters. Note that the
results for different values of kappa can be deduced from
Equation (2); for example, with Maxwellians, 7; would
be 30% smaller.

3. The electron kinetic temperature, T, is deduced from the
high-frequency part of the spectrum. For antennas long
enough with respect to Lp, the high-frequency QTN
varies as f > and is directly proportional to the kinetic
temperature and is independent of the separation between
the antenna arms (Meyer- Vernet & Perche 1989) ; a result
independent of the velocity distribution provided it is
isotropic (Chateau & Meyer-Vernet 1991). However, for
the first and second PSP orbits, the Debye length is not
small enough, so the kinetic temperature can be estimated
from fitting the high-frequency part of the spectrum, after
subtraction of the galactic noise and the receiver noise
(Maksimovic et al. 2019). Note that, contrary to the
determination of T.., such a simplified method cannot be
implemented in the presence of electromagnetic emissions, which were frequent during encounter E02 (Pulupa
et al. 2020); it is also much less accurate than if obtained
by fitting the whole spectrum, since at high frequencies,
the QTN is of the same order of magnitude as the receiver
noise and the galactic noise.

4. Large-scale Variations
4.1. Radial Profiles of Electron Temperatures

Figure 3 shows the thermal (core, in blue) and suprathermal
(in gold) electron temperatures as a function of heliocentric
distance R in units of solar radius Ro, with the fitted power
laws (in red) given by

for the first and second extended encounters, respectively. Note
that these results are obtained using robust straight-line fits, 1.e.,
minimizing the mean absolute deviation. From its value, we
estimate an error on the logarithmic slopes of the profiles of
about -£0.03.

Both extended encounters have similar temperature profiles
despite the differences in densities. The thermal temperature is
about 3.5 x 10° K at 36 Ro (0.17 au) and 2.3 x 10° K at 64Ro
(0.3 au). The latter value and the radial profile are similar to
those found by Helios (Pilipp et al. 1990; Maksimovic et al.
2005), despite the general decrease in solar activity until the
Helios epoch and the expected overall decrease in coronal
temperature (Schwadron et al. 2014). In contrast, the radial
profile of the suprathermal electron temperature is nearly flat.
The flatness of 7), agrees with the Helios results inward of 1 au
(Maksimovic et al. 2005; Pierrard et al. 2016), but the absolute
values are somewhat higher (1.6 million degrees at 64Ro

Moncuquet et al.

(0.3 au)). This might be due to the crudeness of our 7),
measurements (see Section 3), for which the logarithmic slope
of the 7), profile is more accurate than the absolute values.
However, extrapolating to 1.5Ro yields a temperature of
(1.7-2.1) x 10° K, which is in the range of electron
temperatures measured in the quiet corona (David et al.
1998) and in streamers at the solar activity minimum (Kohl
et al. 1997; Gibson et al. 1999).

4.2. Discussion

With the density and core temperature measured at 0.17 au,
the mean free path of thermal electrons is of the same order of
magnitude of the pressure scale height, 1.e., their Knudsen
number is of order of magnitude unity. Under such weakly
collisional conditions, the heat flux is not given by the Spitzer—
Harm value, whose validity requires a much smaller Knudsen
number (Scudder & Olbert 1979; Shoub 1983), but collisions
are not negligible, requiring numerical kinetic simulations.
Such simulations, taking into account Coulomb collisions,
spherical expansion with a radial magnetic field, and the
electrostatic field produced by the electron—proton mass
difference being computed self-consistently, yield a thermal
electron temperature that decreases with the distance with a
logarithmic slope in the range of 0.6—0.9 and an antisunward
drifting suprathermal component, which tends to have an
isothermal profile (Landi et al. 2012).

This nearly isothermal behavior of suprathermal electrons,
with a nearly constant relative density of a few times
(m./m,)\/* (m, and m, being the electron and proton masses)
were predicted by Meyer-Vernet & Issautier (1998) using an
analytical approximation of an exospheric solar wind model
(Lemaire & Scherer 1971) with a radial magnetic field. The
constant kinetic temperature of suprathermal electrons is a
simple consequence of conservation of energy and magnetic
momentum for electrons escaping from the solar electrostatic
potential and is consistent with an adiabatic anisotropic fluid
behavior, whereas the value of the relative density comes from
the equality of electron and proton densities and escaping
fluxes. The suitability of exospheric models for suprathermal
electrons is due to the increase in the Coulomb free path as the
square of the energy, making them collisionless. This assumes
that if instabilities (Marsch 2006) and scattering by turbulent
fluctuations at electronic scales change the velocity directions,
they also negligibly change the kinetic energy per particle of
this component of the distribution. However, as expected, this
agreement does not hold for the collisional thermal electrons,
for which exospheric theory predicts an adiabatic radial
variation with a logarithmic slope of —4/3, as a consequence
of their trapping by the solar electrostatic potential (MeyerVernet et al. 2003). The weaker observed slope is presumably
due to the heat flux carried by the suprathermal electrons,
which decreases radially faster than R-” (Scime et al. 2001),
implying heat deposition in the plasma. A more detailed
comparison should take into account that our measurements of
T.. and T; concern the temperatures of the two untruncated
components of the velocity distribution, whereas the exospheric distinction between populations involves truncations in
velocity space.

Finally, from the relation T = T. + (n;,/n) x T;,, where T is
the electron kinetic temperature; T, and 7), are those of the
thermal (core) and suprathermal component of the distribution,
respectively; and n,/n is the relative density of the

4.3. Statistics of the Electron Density and Core Temperature
during EOI and E02

Most of the large-scale differences in density between EO] and
E02 that are apparent in Figure 2 do not seem to have

counterparts in the electron thermal temperatures. To examine
this point, below we use our large data set to study the different
regimes encountered.

The top panels of Figure 4 represent the histograms of the
electron density (~115,000 data points) and the core electron
temperature (~112,500 data points) during the first encounter

Figure 4. Histograms of the electron density (left) and the core (thermal) electron temperature (right) for both encounters. For E01 in the top panels, we superimpose a
dilute wind period (November 9-10) as a red dotted—dashed line and a period of dense wind (gray distribution) around the first perihelion (November 3-6). For E02 in
the bottom panels, we overplot a dotted—dashed gray line as the histogram of density and temperature measured around the second perihelion (2019 April 3-6).

determined in Section 4 for T.. During the approach to E01, PSP
showed a complex solar wind structure with different regimes, 1.e.,
slow and intermediate wind from streamers and flow interactions,
in addition to sporadic faster flows from small equatorial coronal
holes, which are typical of equatorial regions (Phillips et al.
1995c; Issautier et al. 1998, 2005; Neugebauer 2001). For EOI,
the electron density histogram exhibits two main kinds of
populations: a dilute electron population (with a mean value
~130 cm at 35.7 Ro) and a dense electron population (with a
mean value ~330cm ~). We superimpose a gray dotted—dashed
histogram obtained during EO1, from 2018 November 3-6; we do
see that this period mainly contains a denser wind population with
a mean value of ~370 cm >. The red dotted—dashed histogram is
obtained midday on 2018 November 9-11, where a faster solar
wind is measured (Kasper et al. 2019). We can thus attribute the
most dilute electron distribution to the fastest wind, which is in
agreement with the well-known anticorrelation between the solar
wind density and speed (Neugebauer 2001). In contrast, the shape
of the core electron temperature histogram shows mainly one
single population for EO1. It has a mean value of 26 eV, whereas
the gray dotted—dashed core temperature has a mean around
29 eV. Contrary to the electron density, the core temperature is
more difficult to associate to specific structures. In particular,
many interplanetary events from denser populations could be
correlated with the same kind of temperature distributions (Salem
et al. 2003).

We have also plotted the distributions of the scaled electron
density (~120,000 data points) and core temperature (~105,000
data points) at 0.17 au for E02 in the bottom panels of Figure 4.
We normalize each histogram to 0.17 au as we did for E01. The
density populations are likely to be associated with three major

classes of solar wind: the quiet undisturbed wind with lower mean
values of density ~120 cm °, which dominates for E02; the
denser heliospheric plasma sheet with intermediate values of
density (290 cm); and the overdense disturbed wind with
interplanetary shocks, density compressions regions, etc., with
higher mean values of density (~400 cm >). Note that these mean
values correspond to those obtained at 1 au, but shifted to 35.7 Ro.
The gray dotted—dashed histogram is obtained from 2019 April
3-6, where the density is 50% smaller than the one obtained
during E01, i.e., ~160 cm”. The corresponding core temperature
has a mean value around 31.5 eV. We can conclude that for this
period, the dilute density is correlated to the highest core electron
temperature. Future works will need a detailed study on the largescale structure of the wind, using in particular the wind speed data.

5. Low-frequency Compressive Turbulence in the Pristine
Solar Wind

The 7s resolution of the density measurements obtained by the
QTN analysis on PSP enables us to deduce the spectrum of
compressive fluctuations at ~36R 5, during the two first
encounters. To analyze the electron density fluctuations, we use
the Morlet wavelet transforms, which are convenient for unfolding
turbulence signals into both space (or time) and scale (Farge 1992).
Figure 5 shows the spectrum of the electron density fluctuations,
normalized to the corresponding mean density value, for each
perihelion where the radial distance is almost constant, close to
0.17 au. Spectra vary as an f'* power law (blue solid line) in the
10 *-10 * Hz frequency range, which is in agreement with some
previous analyses in this frequency range at | au (Intriligator 1975;
Issautier et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2017). For E01, from 2018
November 3-6, the density measurements (see Figures 2 and 4) of

the mean value at ~370 cm” suggest a low speed wind stream
(Kasper et al. 2019). In contrast, for E02, from 2019 Apu 4-6,
the plasma is more dilute with a mean density of ~160 cm © (see
Section 4.3). Although PSP explores different types of wind in
E01 and E02, the corresponding amplitude of the normalized
power spectrum of the electron density is similar, around I at
10-° Hz. However, at higher frequencies, i.e., above 2 at 10° Hz,
the amplitude of the spectrum is twice as high for E02 than for
E01. We have checked that the enhancement of this part of the
spectrum corresponds to the electron density structure of 2019
April 5 (see Figure 2), coming from the fastest solar wind stream,
with Alfvénic turbulent fluctuations (Kasper et al. 2019). Hence,
this dilute solar wind has a higher level of turbulence fluctuations.

A detailed study of the 3D structure of the turbulence needs,
in particular, to correlate the density spectrum with macroscopic plasma parameters; radial distances; values of the
plasma, @; and local magnetic field switch back fluctuations,
which are outside the scope of this paper. As it approaches
closer to the Sun, PSP will give new crucial clues.

6. Concluding Remarks

For these preliminary results on far solar encounters, QTN
spectroscopy has been implemented in a simplified way, mainly
due to the small antenna length, whereas the suprathermal
electrons have been considered globally, neglecting their anisotropy. These simplifications did not affect the accuracy of the
density measurements; concerning the temperatures, the present
preliminary determinations of the radial profiles are expected to be
more robust than the absolute values.

For both studied encounters, the radial profile of the
temperature, 7)., of the thermal component varies as R-°-* with
similar values at equal distances. These values are in the range of
Helios measurements. The temperature 7), of the suprathermal
component has a very weak radial variation, as expected from its
virtually collisionless state, with extrapolated values at the corona
compatible with previous coronal measurements close to the solar
equator. As a by-product, the accurate determination of the
electron density by the QTN enables us to deduce the lowfrequency spectrum of compressive fluctuations around perihelion, varying as f’

Future works will require a detailed study of the structure of the
wind, using the parameters available, especially the magnetic field
and the velocity. In particular, we intend to study the electron

Moncuquet et al.

density and temperature(s) behavior during the magnetic field
reversals and jumps in speed (Bale et al. 2019) and to explore the
relation between density and core temperature with radial
distances. We will also exploit the measured electron temperature
gradient to study the interplanetary potential and the heat transport.

Note that the present results have been obtained independently of those from the onboard electron analyzer of the Solar
Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons instrument suite (Kasper
et al. 2016; Halekas et al. 2020). Comparisons between the
latter results and those from QTN spectroscopy should benefit
to both techniques. Concerning QTN spectroscopy, we intend
to model the suprathermal electrons by taking into account the
anisotropy of the Strahl component and to implement the
technique via fitting the whole QTN spectrum, when PSP will
be close enough to the Sun for the Debye length to be smaller
than the antenna length.

Appendix A
Antenna Arms Separation

The response F(kL) of a dipole made of two collinear wires
of length L with a gap of length s between the wires reads as
(from Equation (32) by Meyer-Vernet & Perche 1989)

Jp (ka)
Vk2L 2

F (kL) = {K(L + s)Si(kK(L + s)) + kL Si(kL)

— k(L + 5/2) Si(k(2L + s)) — ks/2 Si(ks)
— 4sin2(k(L + s) /2)sin2(kL/2)}
(5)

(Si denotes the sine integral function and Jo denotes the Bessel
function of the order of 0). In particular, from the asymptotic
values of F(KL), an equivalent dipole wire length may be
defined as (L+s) for kL — O and L for kL — ov.

The QTN plateau level Vs given in Equation (1) depends on
the response F(KL), including the separation, s, via the integral
over wavenumbers, k, noted as Fo given by

Hence, the effect on the QTN plateau level may be calculated
as a function of the dimensionless ratios L/Lp and s/L at each
step of the algorithm used to derive the thermal electron
temperature. When using the asymptotic values of F(kL)
sketched above, note that the effect of the wire separation on
the QTN plateau level is equivalent to that produced by a wire
length of (L+s) for Lp >> L, whereas for Lp < L (which may

of L/Lp for different values of the separation in the range of
[O—3 |m.

On PSP, the physical separation between the antenna wires
V1 and V2 is ~3m but is alleviated by the presence of the
spacecraft, so that the effective separation is much smaller. By
fitting s in the range of [O—3]m with the algorithm used to solve
the implicit Equation (1), we have empirically determined
s ~ 1.5m, so that, for large Lp and for frequencies below f,,
V1—V2 behaves as a dipole of 2 « 3.5m.

The Simplified QTN Method and Other Noises

Figure 7 shows an example of implementation of the
simplified QTN method (without fitting) to obtain the
preliminary results reported in the present paper, based on

Moncuquet et al.

the plasma peak, f,, and the minimum, V2.,, and maximum,
V2.» noise levels.

Dealing with shot and proton noises—As indicated in
Section 3.2, the observed QTN minimum below f, reads as
Ve., = Vo + Vio + V2, where the main contribution is the
QTN plateau, Vj, given by Equation (1). We focus here on
the minor contributions arising from the shot noise, Vj,,, and
the Doppler-shifted proton noise, V>. which are both varying

as ,/7. but whose variation depends on unknown parameters
that are the antenna direct current potential, ¢, and, mainly, the
wind bulk velocity, respectively:

(1) The shot noise, including photoelectron, plasma, and bias
currents, is detailed in Meyer-Vernet et al. (2017), with
estimations for PSP in the case of Lp < L. Our
simplified method computes the shot noise for any Lp
(from Equation (2) by Moncuquet et al. 2005), assuming
@ =O and that antenna biasing yields a stable noise
modifying V3, by a fixed factor. The ratio V7, /Vo has
been confirmed to be less than 10% for both encounters.
Note that we have kept all the available spectra for the
first encounter, whereas for the second encounter, we
have withdrawn the short (half-hour) periodic tests of
unbiasing. That explains why, for the first encounter, we
can see some periodic short (and unphysical) drops of T,
values in Figure 2 (top panel).

(2) The QTN V; produced by the plasma protons, Dopplershifted by the solar wind speed, and especially its
variation with ,/7. for different values of L/Lp is given
by Issautier et al. (1999b, Equation (22) and Figure 1
therein). With a wind speed varying from 200 to
400kms~' and with L/Lp between 0.5 and 2 (ie.,
typical ranges for both encounters), this yields a ratio of
r= V; / Vo less than 5% within these ranges. So, for each
spectrum, we fit r in the range of [0 —0.05] in our
algorithm used to determine 7. Finally, note that V> 1S
expected to be negligible as PSP will approach the Sun
(Meyer-Vernet et al. 2017, Section 2.8).
