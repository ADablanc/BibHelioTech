[1] Motivated by recent observations and simulations of the formation of a cold and dense
plasma sheet in the tail of the magnetosphere under northward interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) and of the direct influence of the plasma sheet density on the
ring current strength, this paper aims at (1) highlighting how the coupling of these
effects may lead to a preconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward IMF and
(2) performing first tests of the validity of this hypothesis. We have analyzed superposed
epoch time series of various parameters to investigate the response of the
magnetosphere (as indicated by the Dst index) to the passage of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs). We first focused on the difference
between the measured Dst signature and that predicted by a semiempirical Dst model.
For both CME- and CIR-driven storms the superposed epoch results show that the
model Dst predictions tend to underestimate the actual storm strength (by up to
10—30%) for events that are preceded by a substantial interval of northward IMF, as
opposed to those with no such preceding northward IMF. We also analyzed Los Alamos
geosynchronous spacecraft data for these events. The average density and temperature
measured at storm onset are substantially higher and slightly lower, respectively, for
the cases with preceding northward IMF intervals. These results suggest that solar wind
structures may be more geoeffective if preceded by a northward IMF interval and they

are consistent with the hypothesis of a preconditioning by a cold, dense plasma sheet. A
colder and denser plasma sheet may lead to a stronger ring current when that plasma is
convected inward during the main phase of an ensuing storm.

1. Introduction

[2] The investigation of the geoeffectiveness of coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions
(CIRs) has recently gained much interest in the context of
space weather studies and the upcoming launch of missions
aimed at studying such structures and their impact on Earth
[Zhang and Burlaga, 1988; Gosling et al., 1991; Gosling,
1993; Kamide et al., 1998; Gonzalez et al., 2002a, 2002b;
Cane and Richardson, 2003; Li and Luhmann, 2004; Wu and
Lepping, 2002, 2005; Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. It is
known that a portion of CMEs have a well-defined embedded
magnetic flux rope-like structure; these are called magnetic
clouds. Magnetic clouds often have a bipolar structure in their
magnetic field. When the orientation of their main axis has a
significant horizontal component, they are usually referred to
as north-south or south-north polarity magnetic clouds.

Magnetic clouds are often geoeffective structures as they
usually possess a relatively strong and persistent southward
magnetic field component either in the leading or trailing
portion of the structure. However, the geoeffectiveness of
CMEs can also be driven by the preceding sheath region of
the CMEs owing to its compressed and fluctuating nature
[Gosling et al., 1991; Huttunen et al., 2002]. CIRs are
similarly important geoeffective structures [Kamide et al.,
1998; Gonzalez et al., 2002b; Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006;
Denton et al., 2006] as the increased speed during such
events is often accompanied by a southward component of
the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), leading to a strong
coupling through a large solar wind electric field imposed on
the magnetosphere. The geoeffectiveness of solar wind
structures (either CMEs or CIRs) is thus to first order
attributable to the presence of a large solar wind electric field
and a large dynamic pressure [e.g., Burton et al., 1975;
Akasofu, 1981].

[3] A commonly used index for assessment of geomagnetic activity is Dst, which is a measure of the strength of the
ring current. Dst has been shown to correlate strongly with
the magnitude of the solar wind electric field and dynamic

pressure. These correlations allowed Burton et al. [1975] to
construct a semiempirical model of the Dst response based on
inputs from the solar wind parameters. This predictive model
was further modified and adapted successively by O’Brien
and McPherron [2000] and Wang et al. [2003]. It is known
that contributions to Dst come from other (e.g., tail) current
systems as well [e.g., Hakkinen et al., 2003; Ganushkina et
al., 2004]. These currents may not be separated in the present
study. Their contribution, however, may be viewed as part of
the global geoeffectiveness of the events under consideration
here.

[4] From the study of the statistical significance of the
difference between their predicted and the measured Dst,
O’Brien and McPherron [2000] concluded that the errors in
their model were caused by a few rather than many sources.
An obvious source of errors is that of the measurements
themselves [O’Brien and McPherron, 2000]. In addition,
because of the sole dependence of the model on the solar
wind electric field and dynamic pressure, the effects of other
Operative physical processes ought to constitute additional
sources of discrepancy. One such mechanism investigated
here 1s a preconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward IMF; 1.e., the possibility that the magnetosphere configures itself in a specific state as a function of the properties
of the preceding solar wind conditions, which in turn may
affect the strength of ensuing storms. Of particular importance in this context is the formation of a colder and denser
plasma sheet during northward IMF | 7erasawa et al., 1997;
Fujimoto et al., 1998]. Both observations [Borovsky et al.,
1997; Thomsen et al., 1998] and modeling efforts [Jordanova
et al., 1998; Kozyra et al., 1998] have shown evidence for the
role of the plasma sheet density in storm-time ring current
strength, with larger plasma sheet density leading to larger
negative Dst excursions. A lower plasma sheet temperature
may add to the ring current strength as colder populations
may convect deeper Earthward than their hotter counterpart
[Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000]. In this paper we argue that the formation of a cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS) may lead to an
enhanced Dst during the main phase of a storm as that denser
plasma is being pushed inward during the strong convection
associated with the storm main phase.

[s] A number of studies have investigated a possible
dependence of CMEs geoeffectiveness on the polarity of
magnetic clouds [Zhang and Burlaga, 1988; Fenrich and
Luhmann, 1998; Li and Luhmann, 2004; Wu and Lepping,
2002, 2005]. However, a relation between CME magnetic
polarity and their absolute geoeffectiveness (in terms of Dst
in particular) has not been fully pinned down. This 1s in part
due to the lack of extended databases of magnetic clouds, 1.e.,
only a subset of all CMEs. It is further complicated by the
common presence of a sheath ahead of the CME itself, which
often is the first geoeffective part of CMEs [Gosling et al.,
1991]. Periods of calms (defined as a Kp index lower than 1”
for at least 6 hours) before CIR-driven storms have been
noted and investigated recently by Borovsky and Steinberg
[2006]. They showed that such calm periods occur more
frequently prior to CIR-driven storms than during more
typical solar wind conditions. In their discussion, they
suggested that such periods of calm may lead to a preconditioning of the magnetosphere by, in particular, (1) a possible
mass loading after the buildup of a dense plasmasphere
during quiet (low Kp) intervals, and (2) the formation of a

A09208

cold and dense plasma sheet, in response to presumably
northward IMF (as also suggested by Thomsen et al. [2003)).

[6] There is ample evidence that both double high-latitude
reconnection [Song and Russell, 1992; Gieroset et al., 2005;
Li et al., 2005; Lavraud et al., 2005a, 2006] and the KelvinHelmholtz instability [Fujimoto et al., 1998; Hasegawa etal.,
2004] may participate in the formation of the cold, dense
plasma sheet (CDPS) under northward IMF. Here we do not
focus on the relative importance of these processes, we only
rely on the fact that the presence of the CDPS following
extended periods of northward IMF is well established [e.g.,
Terasawa et al., 1997] and that this material has access to the
inner magnetosphere under certain conditions [Thomsen et al.,
2003; Lavraud et al., 2005b].

[7] Any signature of the dependence of storm strength on
the preceding solar wind conditions (IMF direction in
particular) is necessarily embedded in the measured Dst
trend. Primarily, Dst responds to coupling through the solar
wind electric field and dynamic pressure. Therefore, to assess
the role of secondary effects such as a preconditioning of
the magnetosphere under northward IMF, one must either
(1) compare the magnetospheric response of CMEs or CIRs
which have similar solar wind characteristics apart from their
magnetic structure (resulting in a limited number of suitable
events, if any) or (2) statistically compare the actual magnetospheric response to that predicted by models which are
developed to take into account the effects of the solar wind
electric field and dynamic pressure. In the latter case,
systematic differences observed between different sets of
storms selected for specific preceding IMF conditions can be
interpreted to be due to other coupling processes. This is the
approach we use in the present study. In addition, we use in
situ measurements of the density and temperature of the
nightside plasma sheet to assess the role of the formation of a
CDPS as a preconditioning mechanism.

[s] We first describe the data, the Dst model and the event
selection criteria in section 2. In section 3 we show and
discuss the results. These primarily pertain to the difference
observed between the measured and modeled Dst, as a
function of preceding IMF conditions. The connection to
plasma sheet density and temperature is then documented
with measurements of the densities and temperatures in the
nightside sector of geosynchronous orbit. Potential limiting
factors to this mechanism are discussed in section 3.5. We
draw our conclusions in section 4.

2. Data, Dst Model, and Event Selection
2.1. Data

[9] In this study, we use solar wind data from the OMNI-2
data set [King and Papitashvili, 2005]. This data set extends
from 1963 with hourly averages of solar wind data from
various solar wind monitors. Lag times from the observing
spacecraft to Earth are already applied in the data set. The
OMNI-2 data set has the same time resolution as the Dst
index and therefore was used by O’Brien and McPherron
[2000] for the construction of the Dst model described below.
Dst and Kp data are also taken from the OMNI-2 data set. The
GSM coordinates are used throughout the paper.

[10] We also make use of measurements from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory MPA (Magnetospheric Plasma
Analyzer) instruments onboard geosynchronous satellites.

The MPA instruments are electrostatic analyzers. They
measure the three-dimensional energy-per-charge distributions of both ions and electrons. Here we only utilize
measurements of the ion density and temperature, which
are calculated for the energy range [100—45000] eV
[Thomsen et al., 1999] (all ions are assumed to be
protons). The reader is referred to Bame et al. [1993]
and McComas et al. [1993] for detailed description of the
MPA instruments. For the current study, data are taken
from six different satellites in geosynchronous orbit covering the period of interest between 1994 and 2003.

2.2. Dst Model

[11] The Dst model used in this study comes from Wang
et al. [2003]. It is a modified version of the O’Brien and
McPherron {2000] model that is designed to better represent
the Dst dependence on the solar wind dynamic pressure.
These models are based on that originally developed by
Burton et al. [1975].

[12] The measured Dst index is known to have a substantial contribution coming from the magnetopause current
system (1.e., the currents over the entire magnetopause induce
deflections of the magnetic field at the surface of the Earth
that are necessarily included as part of the Dst index). This
contribution ought to be removed prior to analyzing Dst as an
actual index representing the strength of the intramagnetospheric currents, and, in particular, of the ring current itself.
Contribution from the magnetopause currents mainly
depends on the solar wind dynamic pressure and, in the
model used here, is given by [e.g., O’Brien and McPherron,
2000]:

Dst* = Dst —7.26\/Pram + 11 (1)

where P,.,,, 18 the solar wind dynamic pressure, Dst is the
measured index and Dst* is that corrected for the contribution
of magnetopause currents.

[13] In the models, Dst* variations are assumed to be
the result of an injection term (first right hand term in
equation (2)) and a decay term (second right hand term in
equation (2), where 7 is a decay timescale in hours):

© pst¥(«) = Q() (2)

The statistical analysis of the response of Dst* to solar wind
parameters allowed Burton et al. [1975], and later O’Brien
and McPherron [2000] and Wang et al. [2003], to find the
functional dependence of each term in the Ds?¢* variations as
a function of the solar wind electric field (4, or VBz
parameter, in mV/m) and the solar wind dynamic pressure
(P,am in nPa). For the results shown in the next sections, we
used the parameterization from Wang et al. [2003]. For the
injection term Q (nT h'), this parameterization is as
follows:

O=0

VBz < 0.49 mV/m (3a)

— ,
O = —4.4(VBz — 0.49) (“") VBz >0.49 mV/m_ (3b)

0

LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING

A09208

where the best fit parameters Py and y were found to be
3.0 nPa and 0.2, respectively. The decay timescale 7 (in
hours) from equation (2) has the following parameterization:

r= 8 7: 66/(6.04-+Pram )

Bz > 0 nT (4a)

T = 2.40¢974/(4.09+7B:) Bz <OnT

(4b)
The implementation of this Dst* model thus requires that
solar wind data be available. In our analysis, from a given
start time forward, the Dst* index is calculated at time ¢ + At
(At is 1 hour) by straight integration of equation (2) using
the solar wind data at time ¢ as input. In this paper, we will
only show Dst* values, i.e., both model and measured Dst at
time ¢ are corrected for the magnetopause current contribution using equation (1). The results shown in this paper also
hold when using the O’Brien and McPherron [2000]
parameterization instead of that of Wang et al. [2003].

2.3. Event Selection

[14] We study both CME- and CIR-driven storms. The
list of CMEs used in this study comes from Cane and
Richardson [2003]. The list of CIRs we used comes from
Borovsky and Steinberg |2006, also private communication,
2006]. As one aim of our study is to compare measured and
modeled Dst indices, only CME- and CIR-driven storms
having good solar wind data coverage were selected. In
addition, we require that the storms be sufficiently, but not too
strong, 1.e., that during the 12 hours following storm onset,
(1) the Kp index increases to a value of at least 4°, (2) the
difference between the storm onset Dst value and the
minimum Dst value is at least 40 nT, (3) there is neither
obvious strong activity before the storm onset nor a large
multiple peak main phase, and (4) the minimum Dst is in the
range [—30, —150] nT. This last criterion is required to hold
for the entire storm duration and comes from the fact that the
O’Brien and McPherron {2000] model has been derived from
the analysis of storms having minimum Dst values larger than
—150 nT, and it is thus valid only in that range. The storm
onset times were determined by visual inspection of the data
(from the Dst and VBz values in particular). This set of criteria
led to a total of 60 CME-driven storms for which the onset
times are listed in Table 1. The set of 38 CIR-driven storms is
listed in Table 2.

3. Results

3.1. Illustration From Two Selected CME-Driven
Storms

[15] As the Dst* model used in this study comes from a
simple integration of equation (2) forward in time, the choice
of the start time for integration may be critical. For consistency we begin the integration at a similar relative time for
each storm. For every event in this study, the start time for the
Dst* model is taken to be 12 hours before the storm onset
times listed in Tables 1 and 2. We construct the model Dst*
traces for the next 24 hours, 1.e., taking into account the
12 first hours of the storm main phase. We then compare
those to the measured Ds?* traces.

[16] Here we first illustrate the analysis and goal of the
study by showing two sample CME-driven storm events.

“DOY, day of year.

The first CME occurred on 22 January 2000 and the second
on 25 June 1998. The relevant data are shown in Figure 1
for each event, drawn in black and red, respectively, for
24 hours surrounding storm onset. Figure 1 shows the solar
wind dynamic pressure (P,.,,,) (Figure 1a), the IMF magnitude (Figure 1b), the y component of the solar wind electric
field (VBz) (Figure 1c), the IMF absolute clock angle (CA =

tan” '(B,/B,))) (Figure 1d), the measured (solid) and
modeled (dashed) Dst* index (Figure le), and the Kp index
(Figure If). The x axis corresponds to epoch time, in hours,
relative to the storm onset.

[17] The two events were chosen for their clear difference
in terms of the prevailing IMF direction prior to storm onset.
Also, the other main parameters were quite similar during
the first hours of the storm main phase (VBz and P,gm 1n
particular). The 22 January 2000 event (black) corresponds
to a case with steady horizontal IMF for more than 6 hours
preceding storm onset, with an IMF absolute clock angle of
CA ~ 90° (Figure 1d). By contrast, the 25 June 1998 event
(red) was preceded by a strong northward IMF (CA ~ 30°)
for over 6 hours.

[18] For the 12 hours preceding the 22 January 2000
storm, the y component of the solar wind electric field (£\)
was slightly positive (Figure lc), leading to a Dst* value of
the order —10 to —20 nT. The Dst* value during the 12
hours preceding the 25 June 1998 was slightly higher (10—
20 nT) owing to a negative £,, (northward IMF). At storm
onset, corresponding to a large increase in £\, both cases
show a large decrease in Dst*. In terms of the model Ds?*,
that decrease lasts for as long as the injection term in equation
(2) is large enough to overcome the decay term. As F,,
resumes lower values more quickly during the main phase
for the 25 June 1998 than for the 22 January 2000 event, both

the measured and modeled Dst* values start to increase
5—6 hours after storm onset for that event. On 22 January
2000 the Dst* values kept decreasing until the end of the
12 hour interval after storm onset owing to a more
sustained positive £,.

[19] The feature to note in Figure | is the fact that although
the solar wind data for the two events appear similar during
the first hours of the main phase, the model Dst* (red dashed
lines in Figure le) underestimates the decrease in Dst*
measured (red solid lines) for the main phase of the event
preceded by northward IMF. The underestimation reaches
about ~30 nT at 5 hours after onset, corresponding to 30% of
the measured Dst* value at that time. By contrast, the event
preceded by horizontal IMF (black lines) is overall well reproduced by the model Dst*.

3.2. Analysis of CME-Driven Storms

[20] To search for a systematic discrepancy between the
modeled and measured Dst* as a function of the prevailing
IMF direction during the period preceding storm onset, we
conduct a superposed epoch analysis of the set of CMEdriven storms (Table 1). Figure 2 shows superposed epoch
averages for the 24 hours surrounding storm onset for the 60

CME-driven storms. The 60 events were divided into two
sets based on the preceding IMF conditions. In Figure 2, the
black curves correspond to the superposed epoch averages
of the parameters for events which have at most 1 hour
(1 OMNI-2 data value) of IMF absolute clock angle CA < 60°
(i.e., at most 1 hour of strong northward IMF) during the
6 hours preceding storm onset. The IMF preceding the storm
is thus mainly horizontal or southward for these events. The
total number of events fulfilling this criterion is 27 (out of 60).
The red curves correspond to the superposed epoch averages
from events which are preceded (within 6 hours) by at least
two hours of IMF directed northward, defined as CA < 60°.
Thirty-three events fulfill this criterion. In the following, we
refer to the former type of events as “‘horizontal/southward
IMF case” and to the latter as “northward IMF case.” In
Tables 1 and 2, the ““N” (for northward) and “S” (for
southward) notations in the Bz column refer to the subset of
IMF preconditioning to which each event belongs to accord

ing to our selection criteria. The choice of a clock angle of
60° as a selection criterion comes from the fact that both
double high-altitude reconnection and the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability may be effective in forming a cold, dense plasma
sheet for such low clock angle values.

[21] In Figure 2, one observes that (1) the Kp values are
similar for both sets of events (Figure 2e), (2) the VBz parameter (or £), in Figure 2b) and absolute IMF CA (Figure 2c)
are more negative and lower, respectively, in the interval prior
to storm onset for the events preceded by northward IMF, as
a result of the selection criterion, and (3) after storm onset
E\, is somewhat larger in the case of the events preceded by
horizontal/southward IMF. This latter characteristic is responsible for a faster (measured and modeled) Dst* decrease
in the first 2 hours following storm onset (Figure 2d). However, it appears that the overall decrease in measured Dst*
during the main phase of the storm is globally underestimated
by the model in the case of events preceded by northward
IMF (red curves). Indeed, compared to the model predictions,
storms preceded by northward IMF appear to be stronger than
those with no such preceding northward interval (Figure 2d).
For the northward IMF case, the average underestimation is
of ~10 nT a few hours after storm onset. The observed
difference is of the order of the average absolute deviation of
the mean (i.e., the average absolute deviation from the mean

divided by the square root of the number of events) shown as
the statistical error bars on both the measured and modeled
Dst*, and is therefore not dramatic. However, it corresponds
to ~15% of the average Ds?f* at this time; this trend will
be confirmed by the separate study of CIR-driven storms in
section 3.3.

[22] It is worth noting that the correction (equation (1)) to
remove the influence of the magnetopause current system
does not seem to perform well generally. Figure 2a shows that
the dynamic pressure of the solar wind (P,.,,,,) 1s large for both
sets of events. The discrepancy observed before storm onset
between the modeled and measured Dst* for both cases
(Figure 2d) suggests that the pressure correction is not large
enough. The discrepancy is slightly larger for the northward
IMF cases (which have larger solar wind pressure associated with them). If an additional pressure correction were
applied to the high-P,.,,, main phase interval after onset, the
corrected Dst* would fall even further below the modeled
value for the northward IMF case, therefore increasing the
discrepancy for these conditions.

3.3. Analysis of CIR-Driven Storms

[23] Figure 3 presents the superposed epoch results from
the analysis of the 38 CIR-driven storms listed in Table 2. The
analysis performed and the event selection criteria are exactly
the same as those used in the previous section for CMEdriven storms. The format of Figure 3 is the same as Figure 2.
The total number of events corresponding to the horizontal/
southward (northward) IMF case is 24 (14) out of 38.

[24] In Figure 3, one again observes that (1) the Kp values
(Figure 3e) are similar for both sets of events (horizontal/
southward and northward IMF cases), (2) the VBz parameter
(or £,, Figure 3b) and absolute IMF CA (Figure 3c) are
more negative and lower, respectively, in the interval prior to
storm onset for the events preceded by northward IMF (red
curves), again as a result of the selection criteria, and (3) after
storm onset, £\, is somewhat larger in the case of the events
preceded by horizontal/southward IMF (black curves). In this
case, this latter characteristic does not result in any clearly
faster Dst* decrease in the first hours following storm onset
as far as the measured Dst* is concerned (Figure 3d). The
modeled Dst* depends directly on this parameter (Vz or £,,),
however, and it therefore decreases slightly faster for the
horizontal/southward IMF case. As discussed for CMEdriven storms in the previous section, a possible misrepresentation of the magnetopause current system correction may
be indicated in Figure 3d as the slight difference between the
modeled and observed Ds?* in the immediate prestorm hours.

[25] In terms of the general trends, for CIR-driven storms
the model Dst* again globally underestimates the decrease
in measured Dst* when the IMF has been northward in the
6 hours preceding storm onset. Compared to the model
predictions, storms with preceding northward IMF intervals
are stronger than those without (Figure 3d). The difference
between the model and observations is even more significant
than for the case of CME-driven storms when compared to
the statistical error bars. The average underestimation is more
than 10 nT for the northward IMF case a few hours after
storm onset. It corresponds to ~20% of the average Dst* at
this time. This separate study of CIR-driven storms thus
confirms the global underestimation of the Dst* magnitude

by the model when the IMF has been northward for a
substantial interval before storm onset.

[26] We performed similar analyses using different criteria
for the selection of northward IMF cases. The superposed
epoch results for both CMEs and CIRs show a consistently
larger Dst* magnitude than the model when one requires at
least 3 and 4 hours of preceding northward IMF. Other
analyses based on the IMF direction over the 12 hours
preceding storm onset also confirmed this trend. This trend
holds true when other sensible criteria are used for the
definition of northward and horizontal/southward IMF cases.

[27] This underestimation of storm strength by the model
may be attributed to additional physical processes not taken
into account in the model formulation. We propose that such
an additional coupling mechanism may be the occurrence of
a preconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward
IMF through the formation of a cold, dense plasma sheet in
the midtail of the magnetosphere. To test this hypothesis, we
study Los Alamos geosynchronous data for both sets of
events in the next section. Geosynchronous spacecraft have
previously been shown to constitute good monitors of plasma
sheet access to the inner magnetosphere [Korth et al., 1999;
Thomsen et al., 2003; Denton et al., 2005; Lavraud et al.,
2005b].

3.4. Geosynchronous Data and Combined Results

[28] Figure 4 shows superposed epoch results for the
combined set of CME- and CIR-driven storms, zoomed on
the early storm main phase. The black and red curves (apart
from Figure 4c) correspond to data from the set of events
defined as horizontal/southward and northward IMF cases,
respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Figures 4a and 4b show the 1on
density and temperature measured onboard Los Alamos
geosynchronous spacecraft, sorted by preceding southward/
horizontal (black) and northward (red) IMF. All available
measurements during the time intervals of interest in the
nightside region (1800—0600 LT) of geosynchronous orbit
are used; the trends are similar when only considering
measurements closer to midnight, but the statistics decrease.
Figure 4c shows the superposed epoch averages of the
measured (solid lines) and modeled (dashed lines) Dst* for
all storms, without sorting by preceding IMF. Figure 4d
shows the superposed epoch averages of the measured (solid
lines) and modeled (dashed lines) Dst*, sorted by preceding
southward/horizontal (black) and northward (red) IMF.
Figure 4e shows the superposed epoch averages of the
difference between the measured and modeled Dst*, sorted
by preceding southward/horizontal (black) and northward
(red) IMF, together with that for all events, 1.e., without
sorting by preceding IMF (dotted black line). Figure 4f shows
the superposed epoch averages for the Kp index, sorted by
preceding southward/horizontal (black) and northward
(red) IMF. Apart from 14 CIRs that occurred in the 1970s
(Table 2), there are typically several geosynchronous spacecraft operative and contributing to the averages of Figures 4a
and 4b. Figures 4c—4f show the results for all CMEs and
CIRs, but those trends hold if the 14 CIRs from the 1970s are
taken out of the averages.

[29] The global trends in the measured and modeled Dst*
for the combined set of events follow those from the separate
sets discussed earlier. Figure 4 shows that the model slightly
underestimates storm strength when all events are taken into

7 of 10
A09208

account (Figure 4c) and that in the cases preceded by
southward/horizontal IMF the model better reproduces the
measured Dst* (Figure 4d). By contrast, the model underestimates even more the strength of storms preceded by
northward IMF, which is made clear in Figure 4e were the
difference between measured and modeled Dst* are shown.
The reason why the model underestimates the strength of
storms when all events are taken into account is unclear. It
may come from the fact that the model of O’Brien and
McPherron |{2000] was not constructed based on the present
set of storms. In a relative sense, however, it is clear that the
model Dst* globally tends to underestimate the ring current
strength during the main phase of storms that have been
preceded by a substantial interval of northward IMF. Note
that we have performed this analysis using start times, for
integration of the Burton formula, closer to the storm onset
time (1.e., less than 12 hours), and the results confirmed the
relative underestimation (by similar amounts) of the storm
strength for events preceded by northward IMF. The underestimation attains ~5—10 nT which is ~10—20% of the Dst*
value at that time. For isolated cases with strong and
sustained northward IMF preceding the storm, such as for
the north-south polarity magnetic cloud of 25 June 1998 in
Figure 1, the underestimation may even be greater (e.g.,
30%). Although the trend observed in the present study
appears systematic (observed for different sets of events),
the error bars associated with them are of the order of the
difference itself. Therefore additional studies will be required
to further confirm and constrain this tendency when larger
CME and CIR sets are available.

[30] Los Alamos data in Figures 4a and 4b show a clear
tendency for the plasma sheet accessing geosynchronous
orbit in the midnight sector around storm onset to have a
much larger density and a slightly lower temperature in the
case of storms preceded by intervals of northward IMF than
in the case of storms preceded by horizontal/southward
IMF. This ensemble of results 1s compatible with the
hypothesis that a preceding northward IMF interval leads
to the formation of a cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS),
which in turn is pushed inward by the increased convection
at storm onset. This larger plasma sheet density seems to
lead to a larger ring current than a more tenuous plasma
sheet for similar solar wind driving conditions (within error
uncertainties), as was suggested in the study by Thomsen et
al. [1998] and several simulation studies [Jordanova et al.,
1998; Kozyra et al., 1998]. The colder nature of the plasma
sheet also has a potential geoeffective role, as colder plasma
can be convected further inward than hot plasma that curvature and gradient drifts more readily out of the ring current region [Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000].

3.5. Discussion

[31] In this section, we discuss the results and associated
potential limiting factors in relation with the preconditioning mechanism presented in this paper. These pertain to
(1) limitations due to statistical aspects and data availability,
(2) the effects from the magnetopause current system and
solar wind dynamic pressure, (3) the contribution of ionospheric plasma to the ring current, (4) the removal/expulsion
of part of the plasma sheet from the magnetotail at storm
onset, and (5) the mass loading of dayside reconnection (and

LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING

convection) owing to the formation of a plasmasphere under
northward IMF.

[32] The survey of the individual events constituting the
data set used in this study revealed that a majority of CMEs
and CIRs are preceded by relatively variable conditions,
including that in magnetic field direction. To address the
topic of this paper, we have used the criteria which we
thought most sensible (see section 3.2). However, the effects
of variable IMF direction, in particular, on the formation of
the cold, dense plasma sheet could not be assessed thoroughly.
In the future, this mechanism ought to be studied by use of
more extended data sets, out of which significant lists of
events with preceding steady conditions may be identified;
1.e., in order to fully isolate the effect sought in the present
paper.

[33] An interesting result regarding the Burton formulation is seen in all figures plotting the modeled and observed
pressure-corrected Dst*. It appears that prior to the storm,
the pressure correction is not sufficient to account for the
measured Dst*, and thus the measured values in all cases lie
above the modeled ones. This discrepancy is quickly
recovered as the activity increases at storm onset. As one
interpretation, it is noted that Siscoe et al. [2005] recently
discussed the dependence of the pressure correction on the
driving electric field. They concluded that the correction is
largest for lowest levels of the driving electric field and goes
to almost zero as the driving electric field reaches values
close to 10 mV/m. If such a VBz dependence was adopted,
this would tend to reduce the pressure correction after the
storm onset. However, as the changes to the model and
observations would be similar in both preconditioning
cases, it appears that our conclusions would remain unchanged. Also, concerning the Burton formulation, we wish
to point out that the parameterization performed by O’Brien
and McPherron [2000] was made statistically using data
from both quiet and active times.

[34] Large ring current development is associated with
large-scale magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances.
During such active times, the ionosphere supplies the
plasma sheet with large amounts of material, out of which
O" ions have been shown to contribute most [e.g., Young et
al., 1982; Lennartsson, 1995; Nosé et al., 2003]. Therefore,
although the solar wind is known to be an important source
of plasma for the plasma sheet (and in turn the ring current),
the contribution of O" ions to the plasma sheet density and
to the ring current strength has been shown to be important
(and sometimes dominant) [Hamilton et al., 1988; Daglis et
al., 1993; Daglis, 1997]. Therefore a potential masking
factor to the preconditioning mechanism discussed here
comes from the fact that the solar wind (implying the cold,
dense plasma sheet) is not the sole source of material for the
ring current. However, the timings of the two effects are
different: while the preconditioning takes place during the
hours prior to the onset, and hence affects the storm early
main phase, the increase in the ionospheric outflow and
especially oxygen outflow is enhanced only as the level of
activity increases toward the peak of the main phase. Thus,
even assuming that Dst carries a signature from the ionospheric outflows, the conclusions about the preconditioning
effect discussed here remain unchanged.

[35] The onset of enhanced convection that transports the
plasma sheet toward geosynchronous orbit and the ring

8 of 10
A09208

current also leads to magnetic reconnection in the midtail,
which would result in the (tailward) expulsion of the plasma
sheet located tailward of the reconnection line. Thus, even
when preconditioning by northward IMF occurs, only a
limited portion of the tail CDPS 1s transported to the inner
magnetosphere. In other words, the denser plasma of the
CDPS may constitute a source for the ring current only in the
early stage of the main phase, after which it may be replaced
by fresh plasma that has different characteristics. Substorms
or other processes associated with midtail reconnection
would thus cut the supply of cold and dense plasma (CDPS)
to the inner magnetosphere and therefore limit the effects of
this preconditioning mechanism. From Figure 4a denser
plasma sheet is detected at geosynchronous orbit for
2—4 hours following storm onset in the northward IMF case.
This constitutes a lower timescale limit to the influence of the
CDPS on the ring current, which is located deeper inside
geosynchronous orbit. Exact timescales for this process will
be determined in future work from comparisons with ring
current models.

[36] Finally, recent works have suggested [Borovsky and
Steinberg, 2006; Borovsky and Denton, 2006] that the
formation of a dense plasmasphere during northward IMF
may in turn lower the dayside reconnection rate (e.g., as
indicated by the Polar Cap Index), by decreasing the Alfvén
speed near the reconnection site, after an increase in
convection has led to the formation of a plasmaspheric
plume on the dayside. This scenario also constitutes a
preconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward
IMF (quiet conditions are also conducive to the formation
of a plasmasphere). If one presumes that dayside reconnection influences global convection, and indirectly the
strength of storms, this mechanism would be counteracting
the preconditioning mechanism due to the formation of a
cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS). However, in the context of
the present study, the fact that the Kp values for northward
and southward/horizontal IMF cases in Figure 4f closely
follow each other suggests that the present results (for our set
of events) are independent of this other mechanism.

4. Conclusion

[37] We have studied the possible preconditioning effect
of the IMF history on the geoeffectiveness of both CMEs
(60 events) and CIRs (38 events). We have analyzed the
magnetospheric response to those two types of solar wind
structures (1) in terms of both measured and modeled Dst*
index and (2) in terms of the associated geosynchronous
observations of the density and temperature of the plasma
sheet accessing the inner magnetosphere at storm onset. We
first focused on the difference between measured and modeled [Wang et al., 2003] Dst* signatures during those events.
We have shown that, for both cases separately as well as
combined, the model Dst* tends to underestimate the actual
storm strength for events that are preceded by northward IMF
intervals. Although the differences observed are of the order
of the error bars, this trend was confirmed separately for the
two sets of storms, 1.e., CME- and CIR-driven storms. The
average underestimation is of the order of S—10 nT, which
corresponds to 10—20% of the average Dst* value for these
events. This result suggests that, for similar solar wind
electric field and dynamic pressure profiles, CME or CIR

LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING

A09208

structures that are preceded by strongly northward IMF are
more geoeffective than those preceded by horizontal/southward IMF. An example 1s the storm driven by the north-south
polarity magnetic cloud on 25 June 1998, which shows an
underestimation of ~30% in the magnitude of Dst*.

[38] We further analyzed the available Los Alamos geosynchronous data for the events under consideration and
demonstrated that the plasma sheet density and temperature
in the midnight sector around storm onset are significantly larger and slightly lower, respectively, for the events
preceded by northward IMF intervals. This fact shows the
presence of a colder and denser plasma sheet before storm
onset in the midtail region and formed under the prevailing
northward IMF conditions. This cold, dense plasma sheet
apparently is conducive of an increased ring current owing to
potentially both its larger density and colder nature. The
formation ofa cold, dense plasma sheet under northward IMF
thus seems to precondition the magnetosphere by leading to
the creation of a stronger ring current during the early main
phase of the ensuing storm.

[39] These results highlight the necessity for further studies
of this, as well as other, potential preconditioning processes.
Future models need to better represent the effects of such preconditioning mechanisms through the addition of appropriate
formulations in the Dst models. The current number of CME
and CIR events of substantial strength and with good solar
wind data coverage (and steady preceding conditions) may not
be extensive enough to perform such a task. However, the fact
that north-south polarity magnetic clouds are expected to
become prevalent during solar cycle 24 starting in 2007
[Mulligan et al., 1998; Li and Luhmann, 2004] may enable
us (1) to further confirm, (2) to better quantify this mechanism, and (3) to potentially implement it in more elaborate
schemes [e.g., Zemerin and Li, 2002] of Dst prediction.
