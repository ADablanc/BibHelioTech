For a given class & of binary pulsars in the Galaxy, the probability density function P(A,,) for the corresponding merger rate A, is obtained from the relation® P(Ry) = A*Rye 4% where A = 7,/(Nxf,), Nx is a population scaling factor (see text), T, |S the binary pulsar lifetime and f, is the correction factor due to the beamed nature of the radio pulsar emission.
The dashed line represents the reference probability density function corresponding to the merger rate R oq = AR4913 + Ris534 due to PSR B1913+16 and PSR B1534+12 only®.
The heavy solid line represents the probability density function corresponding to the new merger rate Anew = Ao737 + A1913 + A 1534.
The parameters adopted for PSR J07:37 - 30:39 are those derived in the text (No737 = 6N4913, T0737 = 185 Myr) and the beaming factor for PSR J07:37 - 30:39, fo737, is chosen as the average of the beaming factor of the other two known merging binaries (fo737 = 1.06f;913).
The dotted vertical lines represent the 68% and 95% confidence level boundaries on the determination of the increase factor.
The dominant role of PSR J07:37 - 30:39 in shaping the new statistics of the double-neutron-star merger rate is evident.
Extensive simulations (V.K.
et al., manuscript in preparation) produce results consistent with that derived in Fig.
2, and show that the peak of the merger rate increase factor resulting from the discovery of PSR J07:37 - 30:39 lies in the range 6 to 7 and is largely independent of the adopted pulsar population model.
On the other hand, the actual predicted value of the Galactic merger rate and hence the detection rate by gravity wave detectors depends on the shape of the pulsar luminosity function.
For the most favourable distribution model available (model 15 of ref.
6), the updated cosmic detection rate for first-generation gravity wave detectors such as VIRGO”, LIGO” and GEO” can be as high as 1 every 1-2 yr at the 95% confidence level.
After a few years of operation of the gravity wave detectors, it should be possible to test these predictions directly and thus place better constraints on the cosmic population of double-neutron-star binaries.

Mende’ "Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 947:20 - 74:50, USA *Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA The most important process that allows solar-wind plasma to cross the magnetopause and enter Earth’s magnetosphere is the merging between solar-wind and terrestrial magnetic fields of opposite sense—magnetic reconnection’.
It is at present not known whether reconnection can happen in a continuous fashion or whether it is always intermittent.
Solar flares* and magneto 533 letters to nature spheric substorms*—two phenomena believed to be initiated by reconnection—are highly burst-like occurrences, raising the possibility that the reconnection process is intrinsically intermittent, storing and releasing magnetic energy in an explosive and uncontrolled manner.
Here we show that reconnection at Earth’s high-latitude magnetopause is driven directly by the solar wind, and can be continuous and even quasi-steady over an extended period of time.
The dayside proton auroral spot in the ionosphere—the remote signature of high-latitude magnetopause reconnection*—is present continuously for many hours.
We infer that reconnection is not intrinsically intermittent; its steadiness depends on the way that the process is driven.

The dayside proton auroral spot imaged by the IMAGE spacecraft (see Fig.
2) is created by precipitating solar wind protons that have crossed the high-latitude magnetopause and were accelerated by the magnetic kink resulting from magnetic reconnection between the solar-wind’s and Earth’s magnetic fields.
Reconnection in this case happens between a northward (up in the figure) along the Zaxis of the geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system directed solar-wind magnetic field and opposite magnetospheric field lines at the high-latitude location.

The Spectrographic Imager channel SI-12 on board the IMAGE spacecraft observes precipitating, high-energy protons'®.
On their way down along magnetic field lines, energetic protons temporarily capture electrons from the high-altitude atmospheric atoms and molecules.
These newly formed hydrogen atoms may be in an excited state.
When the atom decays to the ground state it releases a photon at the Lyman-a wavelength (121.567 nm).
The SI-12 observes Doppler-shifted Lyman-c emission from precipitating protons with energy of several keV.
The images are shown in a geomagnetic grid of latitudes and local time with the noon meridian at the top 534 © 2003 Nature Publishing Group Models of reconnection are typically steady state.
They describe what happens once the process is initiated and allowed to proceed indefinitely.
Transient reconnection models have also been developed, which describe the consequence of artificially varying the reconnection rate, even including times when the rate drops to zero”.
A key unanswered question, both theoretically and observationally, is how long the process can maintain itself naturally once initiated®.
In other words, is the process intrinsically intermittent or continuous? Intermittent reconnection turns on and off.
Continuous reconnection operates at a variable rate but never ceases; if the fluctuation is a small fraction of the average then the reconnection is classed as ‘quasi-steady.
Attempts to deduce the steadiness of reconnection on the basis of in situ magnetopause observations were inconclusive’.
Because signatures of reconnection (for example, plasma jets) are localized in the thin magnetopause, they can be observed only for a short time (a few minutes) when a spacecraft intersects the layer, even if the reconnection is actually continuous.
Much of the published literature from ground-based or in situ measurements in the cusp has reported intermittent reconnection® ”, It has been established recently that the dayside proton auroral spot'*'* is created directly by solar-wind protons leaking through, and accelerated at, the magnetopause by way of reconnection between solar-wind and magnetospheric magnetic fields* (Fig.
1).
The proton aurora spot is detected by the SI-12 imager on the IMAGE spacecraft’’.
It detects the Doppler-shifted Lyman-a photons corresponding to precipitating charge-exchanged protons with energies of a few keV.
As this is not the average energy of a typical proton distribution in the shocked solar wind, some sort of energization process is required.
Magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause readily provides this energization’.
Thus, the SI-12 imager is well suited to provide global images of the aurora created from precipitating protons that have been energized by magnetic reconnection at an active reconnection site.
Here we report two notable examples of long-duration proton auroral spot observations that imply continuous and even quasi 8:56 1 4:26:09 a - ” .

These observations were made during northward solar-wind magnetic field conditions, when the reconnection site is expected to be at the highlatitude magnetopause where the solar-wind and magnetospheric magnetic fields are antiparallel (Fig.
1).
The first reconnection event occurred on 18 March 2002 (Fig.
2).
For the entire ~4-h interval shown, the solar-wind dynamic pressure (Fig.
3a) was constant (~17 nPa).
The solar-wind magnetic field (B, Fig.
3b) was persistently northward directed (B, > 0) while its y (east-west) component (B,) fluctuated between positive and negative.
Figures 2 and 3c—e show the uninterrupted presence of a bright proton auroral spot during this ~4-h interval.
During a brief interval (5 min), the Cluster spacecraft by chance crossed the highlatitude magnetopause and observed proton jets accelerated by reconnection at the magnetopause*.
The reconnection jets were observed on field lines that are linked to the spot in the ionosphere and with energy fluxes consistent with the spot brightness, thus providing direct evidence that the spot represents the remote signature of high-latitude magnetopause reconnection.
Although Cluster could only observe reconnection for 5 min, the uninterrupted presence of the spot in the images in Fig.
2 implies continuous reconnection over ~4 h.
Note that the peak and average brightness of the spot (Fig.
3c) remained high over the whole observation period, with some fluctuations.
After 14:40 UT, the magnetic local time (MILT) location of the spot (Figs 2, 3e) follows very closely the changes in the y component of the solar-wind magnetic field (Fig.
3b), with spot locations at pre-noon MIT for negative B, and with post-noon locations with positive B, (ref.
16).
The correlation implies that reconnection is a directly driven process at the magnetopause and is consistent with antiparallel reconnection.
That is, the reconnection site is located where the internal magnetospheric magnetic field is antiparallel to the external shocked solar-wind field'*'”.
As the solar-wind magnetic field changes, the antiparallel reconnection site moves on the magnetopause.
This is seen in the ionosphere as motion in MILT but not in latitude.
This motion, combined with the near-constant brightness of the spot, indicates that the reconnection site is continuously active (not intermittent).
Thus, viewed globally, the reconnection process never stops at the high-latitude magnetopause.
Finally, as the spot moves in MIT in response to the solar wind B,, it does not leave a long trail in latitude or in MLT, which would have indicated that proton aurorae are still created long (more than 4-5 min) after the cessation of reconnection.
The second continuous reconnection event occurred on  17 September 2000 - 18 September 2000 (Fig.
4).
This event does not have the added benefit of simultaneous in situ observations at the magnetopause.
However, it is remarkable in that the dayside proton aurora spot was observed uninterruptedly for ~9h (01:00 - 10:00 on 18 September), in addition to more than 3h of continuous presence of the bright proton spot during the previous IMAGE apogee (northern hemisphere) pass (16:20 — 19:30 on 17 September).
Before 05:45 on 18 September, similar to the previous event, the MLT location of the spot is well correlated with changes in the y-component of the solarwind magnetic field, with similar implications in terms of antiparallel reconnection.
Between 05:45 and 09:00 on 18 September, however, the solar-wind pressure and magnetic field direction were nearly constant.
The proton spot brightness and location during the corresponding interval were also remarkably stable.
Furthermore, the poleward boundary of the proton aurora spot (red line in Fig.
4d) was also rather stable.
This stability rules out bursts of reconnection with periods longer than 4—5 min (the images are obtained on a two-minute cadence).
Longer periods of reconnection bursts would produce observable brightness and size changes, slow periodic equatorward motions, and sudden poleward jumps of the proton spot poleward boundary.
The above observations can be summarized and further inter NATURE | VOL 426 | 4 DECEMBER 2003 | www.nature.com/nature © 2003 Nature Publishing Group letters to nature preted as follows.
The dayside proton auroral spot, which recently has been shown to be the footprint of high-latitude reconnection, was observed continuously for close to 4h in one event and more than 9 h in another.
The continuous presence of the spot even as the solar-wind condition changed implies that continuous magnetic reconnection was occurring over these time spans.
In a global sense, it is significant that reconnection at the high-latitude magnetopause never stops for any period of time longer than 4-5 min.
For more stable solar-wind conditions in the second half of the second event, reconnection is continuous not only in a global sense, but its rate appears quasi-steady at the local magnetopause as well.
The present finding explains the persistence of optical signatures of the cusp from ground-based observations during stable solar-wind magnetic field conditions'’*”°.
For low-latitude reconnection during southward solar-wind magnetic field conditions, it was reported that the proton aurora could be seen on each reconnected field line for up to 5min following reconnection”’.
In the present high-latitude reconnection case, this time might be longer.

Note the remarkable steadiness of the spot brightness and location in magnetic latitude (d) and local time (e) from 05:45 to 09:00 ut on 18 September during steady solar-wind pressure (a) and magnetic field (b) conditions.
At other times, the spot location is correlated with the aurora image sequences.
Such changes are not seen in our 2-minresolution images.
Thus our findings are in contrast to reports favouring intermittent reconnection, which were made mostly under southward solar-wind magnetic field conditions*"*'*.
This contrast is more surprising considering that reconnection is thought to be more intermittent during northward solar-wind magnetic field, when the reconnection site is located at the highlatitude magnetopause (as opposed to a low-latitude site for southward solar-wind magnetic field) owing to the presence of fast shocked solar-wind flows**.
A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the fact that most of the previous studies of reconnection have been made locally using ground-based or in situ measurements, which could not distinguish temporal variations of reconnection from motion of the reconnection site if the solar-wind magnetic field is not steady.
At the local magnetopause, reconnection could well be intermittent if the solar-wind field changes.
The present results suggest that reconnection for northward solar-wind magnetic field is a directly driven process that is continuous when viewed in a global sense, or even in a local sense when the solar-wind conditions are steady.
This regime of reconnection is in stark contrast to the storage and release of magnetic energy in explosive reconnection at the Sun (associated with solar flares) or in the magnetotail (associated with magnetospheric substorms).
This contrast may suggest that, if driven persistently—in this case the shocked solar wind impinges on the magnetopause continuously—the process can be continuous.
To evaluate fully the controlling factors that dictate the temporal behaviour of reconnection is a major objective of the planned NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale mission’.

Emergence of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate from a Fermi gas Markus Greiner’, Cindy A.

Jin’ 'JILA, National Institute of Standards and Technology and Department of Physics, University of Colorado, “Quantum Physics Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, Colorado 803:09 - 04:40, USA The realization of superfluidity in a dilute gas of fermionic atoms, analogous to superconductivity in metals, represents a long-standing goal of ultracold gas research.
In such a fermionic superfluid, it should be possible to adjust the interaction strength and tune the system continuously between two limits: a Bardeen— Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid (involving correlated atom pairs in momentum space) and a Bose—Einstein condensate (BEC), in which spatially local pairs of atoms are bound together.
This crossover between BCS-type superfluidity and the BEC limit has long been of theoretical interest, motivated in part by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors'°.
In atomic Fermi gas experiments superfluidity has not yet been demonstrated; however, long-lived molecules consisting of locally paired fermions have been reversibly created'’'’.
Here we report the direct observation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate created solely by adjusting the interaction strength in an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms.
This state of matter represents one extreme of the predicted BCS—BEC continuum.
The basic idea behind this experiment is to start with a Fermi gas that has been evaporatively cooled to a high degree of quantum degeneracy, and adiabatically create molecules with a magnetic-field sweep across a Feshbach resonance.
If the molecule creation conserves entropy and the initial atom gas is at sufficiently low temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature Ty, then the result should be a molecular sample with a significant condensate fraction'*'*®.
With a relatively slow sweep of an applied magnetic field that converts most of the fermionic atoms into bosonic molecules and an initial atomic gas below T/T; = 0.17, we observe a molecular condensate in time-of-flight absorption images taken immediately following the magnetic-field sweep.
The molecular condensate is not formed by any active cooling of the molecules, but rather merely by traversing the predicted BCS—BEC crossover regime.
Our experimental set-up and the procedure used to cool a gas of fermionic “°K atoms to quantum degenerate temperatures have been detailed in previous work'”"*.
In brief, after laser cooling and trapping we evaporatively cool the atoms in a magnetic trap.
In NATURE | VOL 426 | 4 DECEMBER 2003 | www.nature.com/nature © 2003 Nature Publishing Group letters to nature order to realize s-wave collisions in the ultracold Fermi gas, we use a mixture of atoms in two different spin states.
For the final stage of evaporative cooling, the atoms are loaded into an optical dipole trap formed by a single far-red-detuned laser beam.
The laser wavelength is A = 1,064nm, and the beam is focused to a waist of 15.5 um.
By lowering the depth of the optical trap, we evaporate the atomic gas to temperatures far below the Fermi temperature Tp = (6Nv? p,)/ - h/kg.
Here N is the particle number in each spin state, v, and v, are the radial and axial trap frequencies, h is Planck’s constant, and kg is Boltzmann’s constant.
For final radial trap frequencies between v, = 430 Hz and 250 Hz and a fixed trap aspect ratio v,/v, = 79 + 15, we achieve temperatures between 0.36Tp and 0.04T;.
(All temperatures of the Fermi gas given in this work are determined through surface fits to time-of-flight absorption images'®.) For this work we use a Feshbach resonance, which occurs when the energy of a quasibound molecular state becomes equal to the energy of two free atoms.
The magnetic-field dependence of the resonance allows precise tuning of the atom—atom interaction strength in an ultracold gas'’.
Moreover, time-dependent magnetic fields can be used to reversibly convert atom pairs into extremely weakly bound molecules'’'**°*, The particular resonance used here is located at a magnetic field By = 202.1 + 0.1G and has a width of w= 7.8 + 0.6G (refs 15, 25).
The resonance affects collisions between atoms in the two lowest-energy spin states | f = 9/2,m,y = —7/2) and |f = 9/2, my = —9/2) of *°K, where f denotes the total atomic angular momentum and m,the magnetic quantum number.
To create bosonic molecules from the fermionic atoms, we first prepare an equal mixture of atoms in the mr= —9/2 and my¢= —7/ 2 spin states at temperatures below quantum degeneracy.
Then we apply a time-dependent sweep of the magnetic field starting above the Feshbach resonance value, where the atom interactions are effectively attractive, and ending below the resonance, where the atom interactions are effectively repulsive.
In contrast to our previous work"', the magnetic-field sweep is not only adiabatic with respect to the molecule creation rate, but also slow with respect to the collision rate and the radial trap frequency'’.
The magnetic field is typically ramped in 7ms from B= 202.78G to either B= 201.54G or B= 201.67G.
With this magnetic-field sweep across the Feshbach resonance we convert between 78% and 88% of the atoms into molecules.
To a very good approximation, these molecules have twice the polarizability of the atoms” and therefore are confined in the optical dipole trap with the same trapping frequency and twice the trap depth of the atoms.
The molecules, which are all in the same internal quantum state, are highly vibrationally excited, very large in spatial extent, and extremely weakly bound.
For a magnetic field 0.43G below the Feshbach resonance (B = 201.67G) the binding energy h*/ma* is 8 kHz, where m is the atomic mass and 2th is Planck’s constant.
The molecule size, which we estimate as a/2, is ~1,650do, where dg is the Bohr radius and a is the atom-atom scattering length given by a = 174a,0[1 + w/(Bo-B)] (ref.
18).
At this magnetic field, the molecule size is one order of magnitude smaller than the calculated intermolecular distance.
A critical element of this experiment is that the lifetime of these weakly bound molecules can be much longer than the typical collision time in the gas and longer than the radial trapping period'?*, In previous work, we found that the “°K, molecule lifetime increases dramatically near the Feshbach resonance and reaches ~100 ms at a magnetic field 0.43G below the Feshbach resonance for a peak density of np, = 1.5 X 10'° cm’? (ref.
15).
It is predicted that this increased molecule lifetime only occurs for dimers of fermionic atoms”.
The relatively long molecule lifetime near the Feshbach resonance allows the atom/molecule mixture to achieve thermal equilibrium during the magnetic-field sweep.
Note, however, that the large aspect ratio of the optical trap gives rise to a 537 .
