The investigation of multi-spacecraft coordinated observations during the cruise phase of
BepiColombo (ESA/JAXA) are reported, with a particular emphasis on the recently
launched missions, Solar Orbiter (ESA/NASA) and Parker Solar Probe (NASA). Despite
some payload constraints, many instruments onboard BepiColombo are operating during
its cruise phase simultaneously covering a wide range of heliocentric distances (0.28
AU-0.5 AU). Hence, the various spacecraft configurations and the combined in-situ and
remote sensing measurements from the different spacecraft, offer unique opportunities for
BepiColombo to be part of these unprecedented multipoint synergistic observations and
for potential scientific studies in the inner heliosphere, even before Its orbit insertion around
Mercury in December 2025. The main goal of this report is to present the coordinated
observation opportunities during the cruise phase of BepiColombo (excluding the
planetary flyoys). We summarize the identified science topics, the operational
instruments, the method we have used to identify the windows of opportunity and
discuss the planning of joint observations in the future.

BepiColombo’s Coordinated Observations During Cruise

1 INTRODUCTION

A new era of coordinated observations in the inner heliosphere
has begun with the launch of NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP,
Fox et al., 2016) in August 2018, followed by the ESA-JAXA
BepiColombo spacecraft mission in October 2018 (Benkhoff
et al., 2021), and by ESA-NASA’s Solar Orbiter (Miiller et al.,
2020) in February 2020. Until the end of the cruise phase of
BepiColombo (November 30, 2025), these three spacecraft will be
traveling simultaneously in the inner heliosphere covering
different heliocentric distances (Velli et al, 2020):
BepiColombo’s elliptical orbit will cover distances from about
1.2 Astronomical Unit (AU) to ~ 0.31 AU, while Solar Orbiter
from ~ 1.02 to 0.28 AU, and Parker Solar Probe from about 0.7 to
0.04 AU. Together with these missions, previous (and future)
spacecraft provide continuous in situ and remote sensing
measurements in our Solar System (as shown in Figure 1): at
Venus ~ 0.7 AU (Akatsuki, also known as the Venus Climate
Orbiter), around Earth, including the L1 Lagrange point ~ 1 AU
(e.g., SOHO, ACE, Wind, Cluster, THEMIS, and MMS), at Mars
~ 1.5 AU (e.g., MAVEN, Mars Express, Mars Odyssey), and at
Jupiter ~ 5 AU (e.g., JUNO). In addition many Sun-observing
including, SOHO, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory,
PROBA-2, and STEREO-A monitor the Sun with various
instrumentations. The exceptional and complementary in-situ
and remote sensing payloads on-board these different satellites,
together with ground based measurements, will give the
opportunity to perform unprecedented multi-point
measurements of the solar wind plasma and the Sun. Hence
allowing the community to address different fundamental
physical processes in the solar wind, such as turbulence, the
generation, acceleration, and transport of solar energetic particles
(SEPs), and the characterization of large scale heliospheric

structures such as Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections
(ICMEs).

During the cruise phase, the BepiColombo spacecraft is in a
so-called “stacked” configuration: the Mercury Magnetospheric
Orbiter (MMO/Mio) is inside the Sunshield and Interface
Structure (MOSIF) which is attached to the Mercury Planetary
Orbiter (MPO). MPO, MOSIF, and Mio are all connected to the
Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) (Mangano et al., 2021).
Therefore, unlike some MPO instruments that are fully
operational during cruise, all the instruments onboard Mio are
shielded by MOSIF and not all of them can be scientifically
operational (i.e., limited field of view, undeployed instruments). It
is only after entering Mercury's orbit in December 2025, that all
the instruments will be fully deployed and operational at full
capacity. Nevertheless, despite some operational and
instrumental constraints, science operations could _ be
performed during cruise in coordination with other spacecraft
missions. Moreover, since long term planning is required for at
least BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter (9 months and 6 months in
advance respectively), a close coordination between
BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, and PSP teams was necessary
(Velli et al, 2020). In this context, the BepiColombo
Coordinated Observations Working Group (BC-CoObs WG)
was initiated in November 2019. The BC-CoObs WG
consisted of the project scientist and deputy project scientist of
BepiColombo, along with instruments Principal Investigators
(PIs) and members from BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter and PSP
teams and researchers from the planetary and _heliophysics
community. The main goal of the BC-CoObs WG was to
identify the science opportunities during the cruise phase of
BepiColombo from September 1, 2020 till November 30, 2025,
excluding the planetary flybys. In order to achieve this goal, we
have defined three main tasks: 1) to specify the different science

topics that are related to the multi-spacecraft observations, 2) to
report the potential operational instruments on-board
BepiColombo, and 3) to identify the potential windows of
opportunities of BepiColombo in coordination with all the
operational spacecraft, by selecting the most interesting
spacecraft configurations.

In the following sections, we summarize the operational
instruments on board BepiColombo, the science topics that
can be addressed during cruise, and some _ operation
constraints. Then, we describe the method and the tool that
we used to identify the different windows of opportunity. Finally,
we discuss the planning of the joint observations and present
some specific examples.

2 OPERATIONAL INSTRUMENTS, SCIENCE
TOPICS, AND CONSTRAINTS

The only official instrument onboard BepiColombo that was
originally planned to be operating during cruise was the
Mercury Orbiter Radio science Experiment (MORE, less et al.,

Non-gravitational acceleration 3.10° — 107'Hz
vector

2021) during superior solar conjunctions. Nevertheless, the
beginning of the cruise phase has revealed that other
instruments on board Mio and MPO could be operating as well
and exploited for scientific studies. In fact, some of the instruments
on-board MPO will be continuously operating during cruise,
except for the Electric Propulsion (EP) periods, such as the
BepiColombo Radiation Monitor (BERM), the Magnetometer
(MPO-MAG, Glassmeier et al., 2010; Heyner et al., 2021), the
Mercury Gamma-ray and Neutron Spectrometer (MGNS,
Mitrofanov et al., 2010), the Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA,
lafolla et al., 2021) and MORE. In table 1, we summarize all the
operational instruments during the cruise phase, excluding the
planetary flybys periods [more details regarding the planetary
flybys periods and the pointing of the different instruments can
be found in Mangano et al. (2021)]. A detailed description about
the combined in situ and remote sensing instruments on-board
Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe can be found in Velli et al.
(2020) and Miiller et al. (2020).

Despite the limited science operations, interesting science studies
can be performed. During the cruise phase of BepiColombo, at least
from September 2020 until December 2025, the Sun will be

approaching Solar maximum (predicted in July 2025). The joint
measurements with BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar
Probe including other operational spacecraft in the interplanetary
space, will allow a better understanding of the evolution of the solar
wind plasma and its large scale three-dimensional distribution under
different conditions of the solar activity using both remote sening
and in-situ meaurements. An extensive discussion on the science
investigations during the cruise phase of BepiColombo can be found
in Mangano et al. (2021). Briefly, the main science topics can be
grouped into seven cases: 1) Solar wind turbulence properties (e.g.,
Tu and Marsch, 1995; Bruno and Carbone, 2013; Sahraoui et al.,
2020). They include studies of the scaling properties (e.g., Alberti
et al., 2020), characterization of the wave modes propagation (e.g.,
Howes et al., 2012), high order statistics, and intermittency (e.g.,
Bruno et al., 2001), and their evolution with heliocentric distances. 2)
Solar wind structures. These include the study of the properties and
radial evolution of small scale structures, such as discontinuities,
including reconnection exhausts (e.g., Gosling et al., 2005), magnetic
holes (e.g., Turner et al., 1977; Volwerk et al., 2020; Karlsson et al.,
2021), interplanetary shocks and of large scale heliospheric
structures, such as transient events [e.g., ICMEs, flux ropes
(Kilpua et al. 2017)], and the Co-rotating Interaction Regions
(CIRs, Richardson, 2018) which are compressive regions formed
in the background magnetic field where high-speed wind runs into
the slower wind ahead (e.g. Pizzo, 1980; Gosling and Pizzo, 1999).
Moreover, the large scale properties of the solar wind (electron
number density and velocity) could be done by combining groundbased interplanetary scintillation observations (IPS) observations
(e.g., Iwai et al., 2019), heliospheric imaging (e.g., Harrison et al.,
2018) and global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and
models such as SUSANOO (e.g., Shiota et al., 2014), IPS-ENLIL (e.g,,
Odstrcil, 2003; Jackson et al., 2015), or EUHFORIA (e.g., Pomoell
and Poedts, 2018). The solar wind plasma parameters measured
onboard one of the spacecraft can also be propagated with the help of
a simple 1D MHD model such as Heliopropa (http://heliopropa.
irap.omp.eu) to another planet, comet, or spacecraft in order to
provide a virtual solar wind monitor and predict the properties of the
solar wind in another heliospheric location. 3) Solar Energetic
Particles (SEPs). The study of their generation, acceleration and
transport processes and their flux-time profiles at different locations
in the solar wind (eg. Miroshnichenko, 2018). Moreover,
combining in situ SEP data with type-II radio burst data, and
global MHD simulations may provide information regarding the
structure of the background interplanetary magnetic fields and the
propagation of ICMEs. 4) Dust and Comets. The characterization of
the dust distribution in the inner Solar System (e.g., Griin et al., 1980)
and the analysis of the cometary composition such as the hydrogen
coma at Lyman-a in Extreme Ultraviolet Violet (EUV) (e.g., Bertaux
et al., 1995). Even though this depends on the passage of the comets
in the field of view of BepiColombo’s EUV spectrometer (PHEBUS),
at least one observation of comet 2P/Encke would be possible by the
end of November 2023 as it arrives at a distance of ~ 0.6 AU from
BepiColombo. 5) Solar Corona. Measurements of the density
fluctuations of the solar corona down to a few solar radii (e.g.,
Miyamoto et al., 2014) will be possible using radio measurements
from the Mercury Orbiter Radio-science Experiment (MORE). 6)
High frequency electromagnetic radiation. These include the

detection of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and their localization, in
particular the gamma-rays that originate from solar flares, and
monitoring the local radiation background of the spacecraft due
to bombardment by energetic particles of Galactic Cosmic Rays. Last
but not least, 7) General relativity test could be performed during
superior solar conjunctions (e.g., Bertotti et al., 1993; Iess et al., 2021).

Two major constraints had to be taken into account for the
planning of the joint observations with BepiColombo. The first one is
related to the Electric Propulsion periods during which no
instruments operations can be performed, and the second one is
related to the science downlink rate, as BepiColombo moves away
from Earth. As one can see from Figure 2, in periods with a distance
between BepiColombo and Earth larger than 1.2 AU the data
downlink rate gets very low (< 0.3 kbps), not even allowing the
instruments’ background operations. Therefore, we assume that all
in-situ instruments can operate in background mode when the
distance Bepi-Earth is less than 0.7 AU (data downlink rate > 6 kbps).

3 METHODS

In order to identify the potential windows of opportunities, we have
focused our investigation on five different spacecraft geometries and
used the Centre de Données de la Physique des Plasmas (CDPP)
tools, in particular the Automated Multi-Dataset Analysis (AMDA)
tool. In the following subsections, we give a short overview of AMDA
and describe the different spacecraft configurations.

3.1 AMDA Tool

AMDA is an online database and analysis tool (http://amda.cdpp.
eu/) developed for 15 years by the CDPP (http://www.cdpp.eu/).
It gathers a large variety of plasma data from space missions and
ground instruments together with simulations and models. It also
offers a dedicated work space to all registered users where plot
layouts, data mining conditions, and event lists can be stored and
reused. Hundreds of user accounts have been provided over the
years from space physics students to senior researchers. Several
papers describe the basics of AMDA and its various applications
in heliophysics and planetary sciences (Génot et al., 2021, and
references herein). Registration is done by sending an mail to

amda@irap.omp.eu, and a public access (with no workspace) is
also available. For the planning activities of the BC-CoObs
Working Group, the choice of using AMDA arose for several
reasons. First, the tool gives access to the ephemeris of all
considered objects (spacecraft and planets) in several common
coordinate systems and measurements at several cadences.
Second, it enables to create new parameters from existing data,
to perform conditional search on a large volume of data-set, and
finally, to manage resulting event lists, and so, to produce
catalogues which are relevant to this study.

3.2 Spacecraft Configurations

The investigation of the different windows of opportunity was
done based on five different geometries, “Cone,” “Opposition,”
“Parker,” “Cone-Parker,” and “Quadrature” and by considering
the following spacecraft/bodies: BepiColombo, PSP, Solar

Orbiter, STEREO-A, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Each of
these configurations are defined below in the Heliocentric Earth
Ecliptic (HEE) system, where the X axis points towards the Earth
and the Z axis is perpendicular to the plane of the Earth’s orbit
around the Sun (positive North). This system is fixed with respect
to the Earth-Sun line.

e Cone: radial alignments between two or more spacecraft/
bodies, ie., when they are within a small longitude cone
from the Sun. For the radial alignment we require here the
maximum cone width of 10 + 3 in longitude without putting
any constraints on the latitude assuming that it’s sufficient
to identify all the events that are radially aligned within a
cone (Figure 3B). The “Cone” geometry allows mainly to
study the in situ evolution of the same plasma parcel and the
underlying processes as a function of the distance from the

Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences | www.frontiersin.org

Hadid et al.

BepiColombo’s Coordinated Observations During Cruise

Sun, such as the properties of the solar wind plasma, and
turbulence as it has been already done using Helios 1 and 2
probes (Schwartz and Marsch, 1983), Ulysses and ACE
(D’Amicis et al., 2010) and more recently using PSP and
Solar Orbiter (Telloni et al., 2021), as well as the evolution of
large-scale heliospheric structures (e.g., Gosling and Pizzo,
1999).

e Opposition: two or more spacecraft/bodies are oppositely
aligned forming a cone with respect to the Sun. The
difference in longitude (in absolute values) between the
spacecraft is defined as 180 + 10. This geometry is
particularly interesting for periods of superior solar
conjunctions, during which — simultaneous radio
occultation observations can be performed to observe
remotely the solar corona using both remote sensing
measurements and ground based observations.

e Parker: magnetic alignment between two or more bodies,
i.e., when the footpoints of Parker field lines passing through
the bodies are in a small latitude/longitude region at the socalled “source surface” (R,), which is an imaginary spherical
surface above the corona. The alignment along the same
spiral field line would allow to study the evolution of the
solar wind plasma that originate from the same source at
different locations on the field line (with a time difference
that corresponds to the travel time of the plasma that
would change over this time). Moreover, it would allow to
analyze unpredictable bursty events (e.g., SEPs) that
originate from the same “active” region on the solar
surface.

For this configuration, the longitude of the Parker field line at
the source surface (¢,) has first to be computed for a given Solar
Wind velocity usw; the formula is given below by:

o, = (1) + O(r — R)/Usw (1)

where ¢(r) is the spacecraft heliocentric longitude at distance r,
Q, = 27/25.38 days, and R, = 2.5Rs5,,. Several values of usw were
used in the range 200-800 km/s, to take into account the slow
(200-400 km/s), intermediate (400-500 km/s) and fast solar wind
(600-800 km/s). At the source surface a small region of 3 x 3 in
longitude/latitude is considered for the footpoints to be said colocated. Varying the size of this region impacts the duration of the
magnetic conjunction. The footprint of a given spacecraft at a
given time is defined by its longitude (¢,) and by its latitude (equal
to the one of the spacecraft as a Parker field line is inscribed on a
cone of constant latitude). Below the source surface, the Parker
approximation to model the magnetic field generally fails as the
coronal magnetic field becomes more complex; refined models
that take into account observed/modeled magnetograms (e.g.,
Potential-Field Source-Surface model Wang et al., 1992) can then
be used. This is what is done, for instance, in the “Magnetic
Connectivity” tool developed at IRAP’ to estimate the solar
source location of the solar wind and energetic particles
measured by different spacecraft. Nevertheless the first order

‘http://connect-tool.irap.omp.eu/

approach explained above and used in AMDA by the working
group is a quick way to derive times of interest for the coordinated
analysis.

e Cone-Parker: the combination of the Cone and Parker
geometries. This configuration is mainly interesting to
study and analyze ICMEs, SEPs, or any other bursty
event that propagates and expands at different longitude
and radial distances.

e Quadrature: Spacecraft with remote sensing instruments
(e.g., imagers, coronographs) forming an angle of 90 + 10
with the Sun and other spacecraft/planet. For this particular
geometry we only considered BepiColombo, Earth (L1
probes, e.g., Wind, SOHO) and the solar missions: PSP,
Solar Orbiter, and STEREO-A. This configuration is
optimal for observing remotely the structure of the Solar
corona (Lamy et al., 2020) or any transient events that
emanate from the Sun, and linking them to the heliosphere
observed in-situ 90 from the Sun-spacecraft line. An
example would be when Parker Solar Probe is in
quadrature with Solar Orbiter. Close to the Sun, the
remote sensing instruments onboard Solar Orbiter (such
as the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager using Thomson
scattering) would be providing imagery of the plasma lifting
up from the limb and so the solar wind plasma parcel that is,
expected to be encountered by Parker Solar Probe further
away from the Sun at 90° from the Sun-Solar Orbiter line
(Howard et al., 2020). The quadrature geometry and the
combination of the in situ and remote sensing measurement
would allow to observe the global structure of the eruptive
events as they evolve in the interplanetary space and
contribute to the understanding of their initiation at
the Sun.

In a recent study, Davies et al. (2021) could investigate in situ
the propagation of an ICME through the interplanetary medium
as Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and Wind spacecraft were
radially aligned, and could observe its global shape and
expansion using the remote observations from STEREO-A as
it was in a quadrature geometry with respect to the SunEarth line.

A detailed description of AMDA’s data mining conditions can
be found in the Bepi-CoObs WG AMDA manual (see data
availability statement). It is worth noting that the travel time
of the plasma from one spacecraft to another was not taken into
account when selecting the different events and this should be
taken into account when considering the radial alignment case
studies.

4 WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY AND
FUTURE PLANNINGS

Using the AMDA tool and applying the method described in
section 3, the investigation of the joint observations with
BepiColombo by the CoObs WG, has led to 921 windows of
opportunity between September Ist, 2020 and November 30th,

2025. We note that this large number of events is mainly due to
the “Parker” geometry condition, that was applied assuming
different ranges of the solar wind speed. The full list of events
is publicly available on AMDA, and will be shared on
BepiColombo’s Cruise Science study group ESA’s website (see
data availability statement). The timetable includes an identifier
(ID) for each case study, the starting and ending time of the
observation window, the geometry, the name of the spacecraft or
objects, whether the event coincides with any particular flyby of
BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter or PSP, or to an EP period.
Furthermore, for each of the considered objects
(BepiColombo, PSP, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, Venus, Earth,
Mars, and Jupiter) we added the minimum, maximum and
average values of the latitude, longitude, and radial distance
from the Sun. We note that movies of Solar Orbiter,
BepiColombo, PSP and STEREO-A trajectories, and the
planning of Solar Orbiter’s joint observations for JulyDecember 2021 (and future plans) are available at Solar
Orbiter’s Science Operation Center website (see data
availability statement).

After identifying all the potential opportunities with the
different conjunctions, a down-selection of the most feasible
and realistic cases was necessary in order to plan and
coordinate well in advance the joint observations, in particular
between the two ESA missions, BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter
teams. The down-selection is based on the following selection
approach: 1) we assume that the BERM instrument is always
operational in the background and not further analyzed, as its
downlink rate is relatively low (38 bps); 2) the EP and instruments
checkout periods are immediately excluded from any analysis; 3)
all the in situ instruments are assumed to be operating in
background mode when the distance BepiColombo-Earth is
less than 0.7 AU. The only question to the teams during these
periods would be related to the spacecraft pointing requirements;
and 4) no events near the flyby’s periods (closest approach +
l week) are down-selected, as the flyby operations are
discussed withing the flyby working group.

The down-selection step is implemented by a small group
including the Project Scientists of the missions, who discusses
9months in advance, a 6months planning period for the
coordinated observations between BepiColombo and _ Solar
Orbiter - and any other non-ESA missions, taking into
account the constraints as discussed above in the selection
approach (Figure 2). The down-selected opportunities are
then sent by the project scientists to the different instruments
PIs of both missions, who analyze the different periods and
specify for each of them a set of information (a priority level,
a description of the observation, operational mode, pointing
requests, and the expected science downlink rate and volume)
that are then studied and validated by the ESA Mission Operation
Center (MOC). Due to the spacecraft and payload constraints,
only few windows of opportunities could be down-selected. In
fact, for the planning of the year 2021 and the first half of 2022
(January 1st, 2022-June 30, 2022), only 17 events out of 349 could
be requested to MOC. Examples of these joint observations,
plotted using 3DView tool (Génot et al., 2018), are shown in
Figure 3 and listed below:

CONCLUSION

In this short report we attempt to summarize the extensive
investigation that we have done within the BepiColombo CoObs
WG to identify the potential scientific coordinated observations
related to BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter and any other operational
spacecraft mission. Despite some spacecraft and payload constraints,
this work has revealed many interesting science opportunities for insitu and remote sensing synergistic observations in the inner
heliosphere even before the orbit insertion of BepiColombo
around Mercury in December 2025. The joint in situ and remote
sensing observations of BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar
Probe including other space, and ground based observatories, would
allow detailed mapping of the inner heliosphere and to better
understand the solar wind properties, structures and magnetic
field expansion at different heliocentric distances. Recent studies
of coordinated observations between BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter
and Wind (Davies et al., 2021), and Parker Solar Probe and Solar

Orbiter (Telloni et al, 2021) and additional on-going studies,
highlight the need for careful advance planning to optimize the
scientific return from this unprecedented opportunity of synergistic
observations. At the time of writing this report, regular meetings for
the planing of the future years are being held and the approved
selected events will be made public to the community and will
available on BepiColombo’s Cruise Science Study Group ESA
cosmos website (see Data Availability Statement).

DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

The SPICE kernels are used for the different missions with the
official data sources as given below. The kernels are regularly
updated at the official sources and in orbitography services
(including AMDA), for instance when reconstructed kernels
are replacing predicted ones. As a consequence the catalogue
of events as it is presented at the time of publication of the article
may change. However, it has been checked that these possible
changes (shift in start/stop times of some events) are limited, and,
for example, on the same scale as the shift induced by varying the
cone aperture of a few degrees (for “Cone” configuration), or the
solar wind velocity by a few 10 km/s (for “Parker” configuration).
