<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report local secondary magnetic reconnection at Earth's flank magnetopause by using the Magnetospheric Multiscale observations. This reconnection is found at the magnetopause boundary with a large magnetic shear between closed magnetospheric field lines and the open field lines generated by the primary magnetopause reconnection at large scales. Evidence of this secondary reconnection are presented, which include a secondary ion jet and the encounter of the electron diffusion region. Thus the observed secondary reconnection indicates a cross-scale process from a global scale to an electron scale. As the aurora brightening is also observed at the morning ionosphere, the present secondary reconnection suggests a new pathway for the entry of the solar wind into geospace, providing an important modification to the classic Dungey cycle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Earth's global magnetospheric plasma circulation, which is driven by the interaction between the magnetized solar wind and the magnetosphere, is known as the Dungey cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dungey, 1961)</ref>. When the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is southward, this cycle begins at the dayside magnetopause where magnetic reconnection opens previously closed magnetospheric magnetic lines. These open magnetic field lines are dragged anti-sunward by the solar wind flows to the magnetotail, where the nightside reconnection eventually re-closes the open field lines. The newly closed magnetic flux returns to the dayside where the cycle repeats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Considering the modulation of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field to this cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cowley, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borovsky, 2008)</ref>, the imbalance of the dayside and nightside magnetic reconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Milan et al., 2007)</ref>, and the patchy/transient nature of reconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Khotyaintsev et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hasegawa et al., 2010)</ref>, the Dungey cycle explains various space weather phenomena, such as geomagnetic storms, substorms and aurorae.</p><p>Magnetopause reconnection, the primary driver in the Dungey cycle, is locally determined by the magnetic shear, the plasma beta and the flow shear across the magnetopause (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Swisdak et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Phan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Doss et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, its location and efficiency at macro scales varies significantly under different the solar wind conditions. In fact, magnetic reconnection is found to be most active when IMF is southward. In this situation, reconnection occurs at the low-latitude magnetopause, spanning from subsolar magnetopause to the flanks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fuselier et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Trattner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vines et al., 2015)</ref>. Reconnection at the flank magnetopause can be affected by the local plasma shear flow, and thus presents some different features (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gomez et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Haaland et al., 2020)</ref>. As reconnection can change the toplogy of magnetic field lines and convert energy to plasmas, they act as a major process responsible for the solar wind entry into the magnetosphere, and the consequent global scale magnetospheric convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dungey, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fuselier and Lewis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Welling et al., 2015)</ref>. Along with magnetic reconnection, other processes such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the flank region <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hasegawa et al., 2004)</ref> or the kinetic diffusive particle transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Treumann et al., 1991)</ref> can also contribute to the mass and energy transfer across the magnetopause. Recently, magnetic reconnection, triggered by local plasma and magnetic field variations at the magnetopause, are also observed. For example, they are reported at the trailing edges of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eriksson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al., 2016)</ref>, at the interface of interlinked magnetic flux tubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kacem et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Øieroset et al., 2019)</ref> and at the boundary of two neighboring flux ropes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhou et al., 2017)</ref>. The local secondary reconnection, which is basically taken as secondary effects of the primary reconnection are also reported (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daughton et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lapenta et al., 2015)</ref>. These local reconnection are suggested to transfer plasma across the magnetopause (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nakamura et al., 2017)</ref>, but whether they can result into magnetospheric consequences at large scales remains an open issue.</p><p>Here, we use observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burch et al., 2016)</ref> to present local secondary magnetic reconnection at the flank magnetopause, which is identified by a secondary ion jet and the encounter of the electron diffusion region. This newly discovered secondary reconnection re-closes the open magnetic field lines previously generated by magnetopause reconnection, providing a new pathway for the entry of the solar wind into the magnetosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>On June 1, 2018, the four MMS spacecraft cross the flank magnetopause for several times approximately at (−15.6, −19.7, 2.2) Earth radii (R E ) in geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates, and the spacecraft are in a tetrahedron formation with ∼36 km separation. We use ion and electron data from the fast plasma investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pollock et al., 2016)</ref>, magnetic field data from the fluxgate magnetometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Russell et al., 2016)</ref>, and electric field data from electric field double probes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ergun et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lindqvist et al., 2016)</ref>. During these multiple magnetopause crossings, the solar wind conditions are relatively stable (Both IMF B Y and IMF B Z are negative, seeing Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), and MMS do not observe quasi-periodic perturbations of the plasma and magnetic field parameters, suggesting Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are not active during this time interval.</p><p>Overview of one inbound magnetopause crossing between 01:01:20 UT and 01:02:55 UT is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The spacecraft are initially located in the magnetosheath, characterized by a high plasma density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) and large anti-sunward flows (V i, x ) at ∼ −400 km s −1 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C,F</ref>), corresponding to a typical energy of ∼ 1 keV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). On the other side, the magnetosphere is characterized by a lower ion density, smaller ion speeds, and the appearance of high energy ions (∼ 10 keV). During this magnetopause crossing, MMS observe a reversal of B z (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), a large northward ion flow (V i, z ) reaching ∼ 300 km s −1 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C,G</ref>), and a mixture of magnetosheath and magnetospheric ions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). Such observations indicate ongoing magnetopause reconnection between the shocked solar wind (i.e., magnetosheath plasma) and the magnetospheric plasmas (referred to as the primary reconnection hereafter) and the spacecraft are located northward of the reconnection X-line. These observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the maximum magnetic shear model shown in Figure 3A <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Trattner et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Trattner et al., , 2021))</ref>. It presents large magnetic shear at the dawnside flanks, which is favorable for reconnection, and MMS is located at its north side, observing a northward reconnection jet. We also test the Walén relation by comparing two vectors ΔV i V i − V i,MSH and ΔV A V A − V A,MSH , where V A,MSH , V i,MSH are the reference plasma Alfven velocity and bulk velocity in the magnetosheath <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sonnerup et al., 1981)</ref>. The result shows that the velocity change across the magnetosheath side of the primary reconnection is mostly Alfvenic (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), indicating this boundary is a rotational discontinuity and open magnetic field lines are generated from reconnection. Moreover, in the reconnection exhaust, we find that the magnetic field has a significant positive B x component (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), and plasmas move anti-sunward (V i,x ∼ −200 km s −1 , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), indicating that these reconnected open field lines are draped along the magnetopause by the solar wind flows (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that an unexpected ion population flowing along the anti-sunward direction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>) appears just seconds before the MMS crossing of the boundary between the primary reconnection exhaust and the magnetosphere, where a large local magnetic shear (∼ 145 °) is mainly due to the B x component (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Here, we explain this ion population as the outflow of another ongoing reconnection at the boundary with large magnetic shear (referred to as secondary reconnection), since it is almost aligned in the -L direction in a local current sheet (LMN) coordinate [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4N</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Russell and Elphic, 1978)</ref>], which is determined from minimum variance analysis of the magnetic field (L [0.97, 0.09, −0.23] is the reconnecting field direction, M [0.23, −0.61, 0.76] is the out-ofplane direction, and N [−0.07, −0.77, −0.61] (GSM) is the normal direction). The eigenvalues of LMN vectors are [λ 1 : λ 2 : λ 3 ] <ref type="bibr">[200.3 : 5.5: 2.6</ref>]. The relative small ratio of λ 2 : λ 3 (∼2.1) is related to a local B N enhancement around 01:02:49.8 UT, and this B N enhancement can be explained by the magnetic flux pileup associated with the electron flow breaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Genestreti et al., 2020)</ref>. We provide a zoom-in of this boundary with more signatures of the secondary reconnection in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. At the B L reversal point (approximately 01:02:50.7 UT), MMS one observes a magnetic minimum at (|B|∼ 1.8 nT, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>), a large perpendicular electron flow in the L direction (V e,L⊥ ∼ −800 km s −1 , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>), and nearly isotropic electron distributions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4K</ref>) with T e,⊥ ≈ T e, (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4J</ref>). At the two sides of the B L reversal point, the electron temperature profile shows clear anisotropy (T e,⊥ &lt; T e, , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4I</ref>), which is consistent with the magnetic field-aligned electrons from the inflow region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4K</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Egedal et al., 2011)</ref>. These ion and electron signatures agree well with the scenario of reconnection.</p><p>We perform a detailed analysis of the observed secondary reconnection, which is embedded in the plasma flow imposed by the primary reconnection. The shear flow is negative in the reconnecting (L) direction and positive in the out-of-plane (M) direction (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C,M</ref>). The negative V L shear flow can lead into the convection of the X-line, and a reduction of the outflow speed in the X-line frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Doss et al., 2015)</ref>. The predicted outflow density (ρ out ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassak and Shay, 2007)</ref>, the convection speed of the X-line (V drift ) and the outflow speed in the spacecraft frame (V out ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Doss et al., 2015)</ref> are written as where the "1", "2," and "out" subscripts refer to parameters in the primary reconnection exhaust, in the magnetospheric side and in the outflow region, respectively, and c A,asym B 1 B 2 /μ 0 ρ out is the outflow speed of the secondary reconnection without a flow shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassak and Shay, 2007)</ref>. Using the values obtained from observations (B 1 ∼ 18.4 nT, ρ 1 ∼ 1.48 cm −3 , V L,1 ∼ −200 km s −1 ; B 2 ∼ 20.0 nT, ρ 2 ∼ 0.43 cm −3 , V L,2 ∼ 0), we obtain ρ out ∼ 0.98 cm −3 , V drift ∼ −160 km s −1 , and the outflow speed at the anti-sunward side V out ∼ −570 km s −1 . Moreover, the shear flow in the M direction, which is larger than 100 km s −1 as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>, can drag the reconnected magnetic field lines out of the reconnecting plane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L</ref>), resulting into the B M variation, and V M reduction inside the reconnection exhaust. During the time interval from 01:02:32 UT to 01:02:46 UT, MMS observes negative B M (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), decreased V M , slightly enhanced V L (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>) and two ion populations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). The high energy ion population, which is almost aligned in the -L direction, travels at a speed of ∼ 500 km s −1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4N</ref>). These observations are consistent with the prediction of reconnection with a flow shear, suggesting a short excursion of MMS into the exhaust of the secondary reconnection. The secondary ion jet decreases its speed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4O</ref>, and is not easy to identify around the B L reversal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4P</ref>), which indicates that MMS spacecraft moves closer to the central reconnection diffusion region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L</ref>). The topology of the magnetic field lines can be inferred from the pitch angle spectrum of high-energy magnetospheric electrons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>), which has been extensively used in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fuselier et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Øieroset et al., 2015)</ref>. In the primary reconnection exhaust with a northward ion jet, an anti-parallel streaming electron flow inside the primary exhaust suggests an open field line geometry connecting to the northern hemisphere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). While inside the magnetosphere, the electron flux is more intense, and mostly isotropic, indicating closed field lines. Therefore, we confirm that the secondary reconnection occurs between closed magnetospheric field lines and the open field lines previously generated by the primary magnetopause reconnection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), which is different from the primary magnetopause reconnection, occurring between the shocked solar wind magnetic field lines and the magnetospheric field lines.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ρ out ∼ ρ 1 B 2 + ρ 2 B 1 B 1 + B 2 (1) v drift ∼ ρ 1 B 2 V L,1 + ρ 2 B 1 V L,2 ρ 1 B 2 + ρ 2 B 1 (2) v out ∼ c 2 A,asym − V L,1 − V L,2 2 ρ 1 B 2 ρ 2 B 1 ρ 1 B 2 + ρ 2 B 1 2 ± V drift ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Spatial structures of the secondary reconnection at the scale of MMS separations near the B L reversal are further investigated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). The reduced/enhanced B M variations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>), indicating a Hall pattern of reconnection <ref type="bibr">(Øieroset et al., 2001)</ref> with a guide-field of ∼ 5 nT, are consistent with the anti-sunward crossing of the X-line. During this crossing, the minimum magnetic field (|B|) at MMS two is obviously larger than that at other spacecraft (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). Therefore, even though the "nominal" magnetic curvature radius (R C ) is comparable with the electron gyro-radius (ρ e , κ 2 R C /ρ e , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5G</ref>) at the time interval of |B|, the expected electron pitch angle mixing due to the magnetic curvature scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lavraud et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tang et al., 2019)</ref> is only found at MMS 1, 3 and 4, but not at MMS 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5I1-I4</ref>). The out-of-plane current density (J M , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5F</ref>) at MMS 1-MMS 4 are also different. In general, there are two main J M peaks; one is at the centre of the B L reversal and the other is near the magnetospheric side. The magnitude of the current density at these two current sheets observed at MMS two is about 200 nA m −2 , which is significantly weaker than that observed by other spacecraft. All these differences suggest dramatic changes of the electron dynamics at MMS separation scales, which can be explained by the spatial evolution of the reconnection structure along the outflow direction. MMS 2 then is the furthermost spacecraft in the outflow region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The peak-to-peak separation of the two current sheets is approximately 0.8 s, corresponding to ∼ 65 km or 0.33d i (the ion inertial length d i ≈ 200 km). Note that the spatial separation is estimated using the magnetopause speed of 80 km s −1 along its normal direction estimated from the multi-spacecraft timing analysis of B L . Such two strong current sheets are also found in the kinetic particle simulation with similar guide field strength and density asymmetry [see (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>-7 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Montag, 2018)</ref>]. In his simulation, the two current sheets, with a separation less than 1d i along the normal direction, extend from the X-line only up to several ion inertial lengths. These results, as well as the electron flow that is faster than predicted outflow speed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>), demonstrate that MMS may cross in the vicinity of the electron diffusion region.</p><p>Agyrotropic electron distributions, which are an important indicator of the electron diffusion region <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burch et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2018)</ref>, are also found during the secondary magnetic reconnection crossing, and measure of electron agyrotropy, Q √ <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Swisdak, 2016)</ref> in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5G</ref> presents several peaks. On the magnetosheath side, electrons with energies from approximately 150-300 eV are observed to be almost isotropic around 01:02:49.5 UT (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, panels (H1)-(H4)), and at its edge, agyrotropic crescent electron distributions in the plane perpendicular to the local magnetic field are found due to the finite gyro-radius effect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5K</ref>). The energy of these agyrotropic electrons is larger than that of typical sheath electrons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>), which are energized sheath electrons and/or the electrons originated from the magnetosphere. At the boundary of the |B| min region, the gyration of the electrons after the magnetic curvature scattering forms crescent electron distributions as well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5L</ref>), and the energy of these electrons are similar to sheath electrons. Finally, agyrotropic electron distributions are found on the magnetospheric side (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5M</ref>), where a density gradient is present. These observed agyrotropic electron distributions not only support the encounter of the electron diffusion region vicinity, but also indicate characteristic reconnection features with weak density and magnetic field asymmetry (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F,G</ref>).</p><p>The secondary reconnection re-closes the open magnetic field lines in the primary exhaust by reconnecting with closed magnetospheric field lines. The newly closed field lines can transport plasma in the solar wind into magnetosphere, which could populate the plasma sheet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al., 2017)</ref> and even precipitate in to the ionosphere. In this study, we present auroral observations in the northern hemisphere from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/F18 satellite, and find some bright aurora in the morning sector (Figures 6) as observed by the on board Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Paxton et al., 2002)</ref>. The magnetic footprint of MMS, marked by a white circle, is also located at one end of the bright auroral arc/streamer. The magnetic field used for the MMS footprint tracing includes an internal IGRF model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thébault et al., 2015)</ref> and an external Tsyganenko-96 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Tsyganenko, 1995)</ref>. Unfortunately, the DMSP/F18 satellite does not fly over the bright aurora region (Figures 6A), which prevents direct observations of the particle  indicates that the usual magnetopause reconnection cannot well explain the bright aurora in the morning ionosphere, and we suggest the secondary reconnection, which generates earthward propagating plasma flows in the magnetosphere, can be closely related to the bright aurora in the morning ionosphere. This relation is similar to that between the auroral streamer at the nightside ionosphere and the flow bursts in the magnetotail <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nakamura et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sergeev et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore the secondary reconnection reported in this study serves to transfer the mass and energy in the solar wind into geospace. Finally, it is addressed that the scanning of the bright aurora at the morning ionosphere is ∼ 10 min prior to the flank magnetopause crossing of MMS, which could bring some errors to the relative locations between the footprint of MMS and aurora. Considering the solar wind is relatively stable during this period (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), this uncertainty for the MMS footprint is about 2 °in latitude and 1 h in longitude according to the drift speed of the secondary X-line estimated above, which thus has not been taken into account here. Based on this point, more observational assessment should be performed in the future investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY</head><p>In this study, we have presented newly revealed secondary magnetic reconnection at Earth's flank magnetopause from MMS observations. The observed secondary ion jet agrees well with predictions of magnetic reconnection with a flow shear, and The concept of secondary reconnection has been widely proposed in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daughton et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lapenta et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fuselier et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuselier et al., , 2018))</ref>, but there are some differences existing in these so-called secondary reconnection. For example, secondary reconnection can occur in the exhaust region of the primary reconnection, behaving as an important feature of 3D magnetic reconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daughton et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lapenta et al., 2015)</ref>. Both the primary and secondary reconnection can be found between the magnetosheath and magnetospheric filed lines, or the magnetic field lines at two sides of the magnetopause, which can generate flux ropelike structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fuselier et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fuselier et al., , 2018))</ref>. In this study, secondary reconnection reconnects the previously reconnected open magnetic field lines with closed magnetospheric field lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), resulting into the re-closure of the open field lines. Regarding this, the reported secondary reconnection, which is found at the flank magnetopause, is different from other secondary reconnection.</p><p>The secondary reconnection here is found at the flank magnetopause with a large magnetic B x shear, which suggests that the primary X-line at the flank and the magnetotail current sheet should not be co-located at the magnetopause (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). In this study, the magnetotail current sheet is twisted due to interplanetary B y component <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Tsyganenko, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsyganenko and Fairfield, 2004)</ref>, which leads a substantial offset of the magnetotail current sheet from the equatorial plane at the flank region (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Meanwhile, the location of the primary magnetopause reconnection is shifted southward of the equator plane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). This noncolocation of the primary X-line at the flank and the magnetotail current sheet produces favorable external conditions for a large magnetic shear, and also the secondary reconnection. A general description of this non-colocation should be investigated in the future.</p><p>Magnetic reconnection between the open and closed magnetic field lines is sometimes referred to as the interchange reconnection. It has been widely applied at the surface of the Sun, which is responsible for the acceleration of the slow solar wind <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbo et al., 2016)</ref> and is suggested to play a role in the generation of magnetic switchbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fisk and Kasper, 2020)</ref>. The present finding shows that this type of reconnection also works in the Earth's magnetosphere, but behaves as secondary reconnection, as it relies on the generation of open field lines from the primary reconnection. Therefore the observed secondary reconnection essentially reflects a cross-scale process from the global magnetospheric scale to kinetic scales, and we suggest this reconnection process is applicable to other planets with similar magnetosphere structures, such as Mercury and Jupiter's moon, Ganymede.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Schematic illustration of the three-dimensional structure of Earth's magnetosphere and the secondary reconnection process at the flank magnetopause.
