We report local secondary magnetic reconnection at Earth’s flank magnetopause by using
the Magnetospheric Multiscale observations. This reconnection is found at the
magnetopause boundary with a large magnetic shear between closed magnetospheric
field lines and the open field lines generated by the primary magnetopause reconnection at
large scales. Evidence of this secondary reconnection are presented, which include a
secondary ion jet and the encounter of the electron diffusion region. Thus the observed
secondary reconnection indicates a cross-scale process from a global scale to an electron
scale. As the aurora brightening Is also observed at the morning ionosphere, the present
secondary reconnection suggests a new pathway for the entry of the solar wind into
geospace, providing an important modification to the classic Dungey cycle.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Earth’s global magnetospheric plasma circulation, which is driven by the interaction between
the magnetized solar wind and the magnetosphere, is known as the Dungey cycle (Dungey,
1961). When the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is southward, this cycle begins at the
dayside magnetopause where magnetic reconnection opens previously closed magnetospheric
magnetic lines. These open magnetic field lines are dragged anti-sunward by the solar wind flows
to the magnetotail, where the nightside reconnection eventually re-closes the open field lines.
The newly closed magnetic flux returns to the dayside where the cycle repeats (Figure 1A).
Considering the modulation of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field to this cycle
(Cowley, 1973; Borovsky, 2008), the imbalance of the dayside and nightside magnetic
reconnection (Milan et al., 2007), and the patchy/transient nature of reconnection
(Khotyaintsev et al., 2004; Hasegawa et al., 2010), the Dungey cycle explains various space
weather phenomena, such as geomagnetic storms, substorms and aurorae.

Magnetopause reconnection, the primary driver in the Dungey cycle, is locally determined by
the magnetic shear, the plasma beta and the flow shear across the magnetopause (e.g., Swisdak
et al., 2003; Phan et al., 2013; Doss et al., 2015). Therefore, its location and efficiency at macro
scales varies significantly under different the solar wind conditions. In fact, magnetic
reconnection is found to be most active when IMF is southward. In this situation,
reconnection occurs at the low-latitude magnetopause, spanning from _ subsolar

magnetopause to the flanks (e.g., Fuselier et al., 2011; Trattner
et al., 2012; Vines et al., 2015). Reconnection at the flank
magnetopause can be affected by the local plasma shear flow,
and thus presents some different features (e.g., Gomez et al.,
2016; Haaland et al., 2020). As reconnection can change the
toplogy of magnetic field lines and convert energy to plasmas,
they act as a major process responsible for the solar wind entry
into the magnetosphere, and the consequent global scale
magnetospheric convection (Dungey, 1961; Fuselier and
Lewis, 2011; Welling et al., 2015). Along with magnetic
reconnection, other processes such as the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the flank region (Hasegawa
et al., 2004) or the kinetic diffusive particle transport
(Treumann et al., 1991) can also contribute to the mass
and energy transfer across the magnetopause. Recently,
magnetic reconnection, triggered by local plasma and
magnetic field variations at the magnetopause, are also
observed. For example, they are reported at the trailing
edges of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (Eriksson et al., 2016; Li
et al., 2016), at the interface of interlinked magnetic flux tubes
(Kacem et al., 2018; Wieroset et al., 2019) and at the boundary
of two neighboring flux ropes (Wang et al., 2017; Zhou et al.,
2017). The local secondary reconnection, which is basically
taken as secondary effects of the primary reconnection are
also reported (e.g., Daughton et al., 2011; Lapenta et al., 2015).
These local reconnection are suggested to transfer plasma
across the magnetopause (e.g., Nakamura et al., 2017), but
whether they can result into magnetospheric consequences at
large scales remains an open issue.

Here, we use observations from the Magnetospheric
Multiscale (MMS) mission (Burch et al., 2016) to present
local secondary magnetic reconnection at the flank
magnetopause, which is identified by a secondary ion jet
and the encounter of the electron diffusion region. This
newly discovered secondary reconnection re-closes the open
magnetic field lines previously generated by magnetopause
reconnection, providing a new pathway for the entry of the
solar wind into the magnetosphere.

2 OBSERVATIONS

On June 1, 2018, the four MMS spacecraft cross the flank
magnetopause for several times approximately at (—15.6,
—19.7, 2.2) Earth radii (Rg) in geocentric solar magnetospheric
(GSM) coordinates, and the spacecraft are in a tetrahedron
formation with ~36 km separation. We use ion and electron
data from the fast plasma investigation (Pollock et al., 2016),
magnetic field data from the fluxgate magnetometer (Russell
et al., 2016), and electric field data from electric field double
probes (Ergun et al., 2016; Lindqvist et al., 2016). During these
multiple magnetopause crossings, the solar wind conditions are
relatively stable (Both IMF By and IMF Bz are negative, seeing
Supplementary Figure Sl), and MMS do not observe
quasi-periodic perturbations of the plasma and magnetic field
parameters, suggesting Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are not active
during this time interval.

Overview of one inbound magnetopause crossing between
01:01:20 UT and 01:02:55 UT is provided in Figure 2. The
spacecraft are initially located in the magnetosheath,
characterized by a high plasma density (Figure 2B) and
large anti-sunward flows (Vj; ,) at ~ -—400 km s (Figures
2C,F), corresponding to a typical energy of ~ lkeV
(Figure 2D). On the other side, the magnetosphere is
characterized by a lower ion density, smaller ion speeds,
and the appearance of high energy ions (~ 10 keV). During
this magnetopause crossing, MMS observe a reversal of B,
(Figure 2A), a large northward ion flow (V;, ,) reaching ~
300kms"’ (Figures 2C,G), and a mixture of magnetosheath
and magnetospheric ions (Figure 2D). Such observations
indicate ongoing magnetopause reconnection between the
shocked solar wind (i.e., magnetosheath plasma) and the
magnetospheric plasmas (referred to as the primary
reconnection hereafter) and the spacecraft are located
northward of the reconnection X-line. These observations
are in good agreement with the predictions of the
maximum magnetic shear model shown in Figure 3A
(Trattner et al., 2007, 2021). It presents large magnetic
shear at the dawnside flanks, which is favorable for
reconnection, and MMS is located at its north side,
observing a northward reconnection jet. We also test the
Walén relation by comparing two vectors AV; = V; Vimsu and AV, = Vag — Va.msu> Where Va msu> Vimsu are
the reference plasma Alfven velocity and bulk velocity in the
magnetosheath (Sonnerup et al., 1981). The result shows that
the velocity change across the magnetosheath side of the
primary reconnection is mostly Alfvenic (Figure 3B),
indicating this boundary is a rotational discontinuity and
open magnetic field lines are generated from reconnection.
Moreover, in the reconnection exhaust, we find that the
magnetic field has a significant positive B, component
(Figure 2A), and plasmas move anti-sunward (Vj, ~
~200kms~', Figure 2C), indicating that these reconnected
open field lines are draped along the magnetopause by the solar
wind flows (Figure 1A).

It is interesting to note that an unexpected ion population
flowing along the anti-sunward direction (Figure 2H) appears
just seconds before the MMS crossing of the boundary between
the primary reconnection exhaust and the magnetosphere, where
a large local magnetic shear (~ 145°) is mainly due to the B,
component (Figure 1A). Here, we explain this ion population as
the outflow of another ongoing reconnection at the boundary
with large magnetic shear (referred to as secondary
reconnection), since it is almost aligned in the -L direction in
a local current sheet (LMN) coordinate [Figure 4N, (Russell and
Elphic, 1978)], which is determined from minimum variance
analysis of the magnetic field (L = [0.97, 0.09, —0.23] is the
reconnecting field direction, M = [0.23, —0.61, 0.76] is the out-ofplane direction, and N = [-0.07, —0.77, —0.61] (GSM) is the
normal direction). The eigenvalues of LMN vectors are [A,: A2: As]
= [200.3 : 5.5: 2.6]. The relative small ratio of A,: Az (~2.1) is
related to a local By enhancement around 01:02:49.8 UT, and this
By enhancement can be explained by the magnetic flux pileup
associated with the electron flow breaking (Genestreti et al.

2020). We provide a zoom-in of this boundary with more
signatures of the secondary reconnection in Figure 4. At the
By reversal point (approximately 01:02:50.7 UT), MMS one
observes a magnetic minimum at (|B|~ 1.8 nT, Figure 4F), a
large perpendicular electron flow in the L direction (Ver, ~
-800kms"', Figure 4H), and nearly isotropic electron
distributions (Figure 4K) with T., ~ T., , (Figure 4J). At the
two sides of the By, reversal point, the electron temperature profile
shows clear anisotropy (T., < Te, ;, Figure 41), which is
consistent with the magnetic field-aligned electrons from the
inflow region (Figure 4K) (Egedal et al., 2011). These ion and
electron signatures agree well with the scenario of reconnection.

We perform a detailed analysis of the observed secondary
reconnection, which is embedded in the plasma flow imposed by
the primary reconnection. The shear flow is negative in the

reconnecting (L) direction and positive in the out-of-plane
(M) direction (Figures 4C,M). The negative V;, shear flow can
lead into the convection of the X-line, and a reduction of the
outflow speed in the X-line frame (Doss et al., 2015). The
predicted outflow density (Pour) (Cassak and Shay, 2007), the
convection speed of the X-line (Vg,ig) and the outflow speed in
the spacecraft frame (Vout) (Doss et al., 2015) are written as

the primary reconnection exhaust, in the magnetospheric side
and in the outflow region, respectively, and Caasym =
\/B\Bo/UpPout is the outflow speed of the secondary

Using the values obtained from observations (B, ~ 18.4 nT, p, ~

~ 0), we obtain pout ~ 0.98 cm”, Varit: ~ -160 kms", and the
outflow speed at the anti-sunward side Voy, ~ —570 kms *.
Moreover, the shear flow in the M direction, which is larger
than 100kms‘ as shown in Figure 4C, can drag the
reconnected magnetic field lines out of the reconnecting
plane (Figure 4L), resulting into the By variation, and Vy

reduction inside the reconnection exhaust. During the time
interval from 01:02:32 UT to 01:02:46 UT, MMS observes
negative By (Figure 4A), decreased Vy, slightly enhanced
V, (Figure 4C) and two ion populations (Figure 4D). The
high energy ion population, which is almost aligned in the -L
direction, travels at a speed of ~ 500 kms * (Figure 4N). These
observations are consistent with the prediction of reconnection
with a flow shear, suggesting a short excursion of MMS into the
exhaust of the secondary reconnection. The secondary ion jet
decreases its speed in Figure 40, and is not easy to identify
around the By, reversal (Figure 4P), which indicates that MMS
spacecraft moves closer to the central reconnection diffusion
region (Figure 4L).

magnetic reconnection between 01:01:10 UT and 01:02:20 UT.

The topology of the magnetic field lines can be inferred from
the pitch angle spectrum of high-energy magnetospheric
electrons (Figure 4E), which has been extensively used in
previous studies (e.g., Fuselier et al., 2011; Pu et al., 2013;
@Mieroset et al., 2015). In the primary reconnection exhaust
with a northward ion jet, an anti-parallel streaming electron
flow inside the primary exhaust suggests an open field line
geometry connecting to the northern hemisphere (Figure 3A).
While inside the magnetosphere, the electron flux is more
intense, and mostly isotropic, indicating closed field lines.
Therefore, we confirm that the secondary reconnection
occurs between closed magnetospheric field lines and the
open field lines previously generated by the primary
magnetopause reconnection (Figure 3B), which is different
from the primary magnetopause reconnection, occurring
between the shocked solar wind magnetic field lines and the
magnetospheric field lines.

Spatial structures of the secondary reconnection at the scale of
MMS separations near the B, reversal are further investigated
(Figure 5). The reduced/enhanced By, variations (Figure 5C),
indicating a Hall pattern of reconnection (Wieroset et al., 2001)
with a guide-field of ~ 5 nT, are consistent with the anti-sunward
crossing of the X-line. During this crossing, the minimum
magnetic field (|B|) at MMS two is obviously larger than that
at other spacecraft (Figure 5A). Therefore, even though the
“nominal” magnetic curvature radius (Rc) is comparable with
the electron gyro-radius (p,, x” = Rc/p., Figure 5G) at the time
interval of |B|, the expected electron pitch angle mixing due to the
magnetic curvature scattering (Lavraud et al., 2016; Tang et al.,
2019) is only found at MMS 1, 3 and 4, but not at MMS 2
(Figure 5I1-I4). The out-of-plane current density (Jy,

Figure 5F) at MMS 1-MMS 4 are also different. In general,
there are two main Jy peaks; one is at the centre of the By,
reversal and the other is near the magnetospheric side. The
magnitude of the current density at these two current sheets
observed at MMS two is about 200nAm~, which is
significantly weaker than that observed by other spacecraft.
All these differences suggest dramatic changes of the electron
dynamics at MMS separation scales, which can be explained by
the spatial evolution of the reconnection structure along the
outflow direction. MMS 2 then is the furthermost spacecraft in
the outflow region (Figure 1B). The peak-to-peak separation of
the two current sheets is approximately 0.8 s, corresponding to ~
65 km or 0.33d;, (the ion inertial length d; ~ 200 km). Note that
the spatial separation is estimated using the magnetopause
speed of 80kms‘* along its normal direction estimated from
the multi-spacecraft timing analysis of B,. Such two strong
current sheets are also found in the kinetic particle simulation
with similar guide field strength and density asymmetry [see
(Figure 3-7 of Montag, 2018)]. In his simulation, the two
current sheets, with a separation less than 1d; along the
normal direction, extend from the X-line only up to several
ion inertial lengths. These results, as well as the electron flow
that is faster than predicted outflow speed (Figure 4H),
demonstrate that MMS may cross in the vicinity of the
electron diffusion region.

Agyrotropic electron distributions, which are an important
indicator of the electron diffusion region (Burch et al., 2016;
Webster et al., 2018), are also found during the secondary
magnetic reconnection crossing, and measure of electron
agyrotropy, VQ (Swisdak, 2016) in Figure 5G presents several
peaks. On the magnetosheath side, electrons with energies from

approximately 150-300 eV are observed to be almost isotropic
around 01:02:49.5 UT (Figure 5, panels (H1)-(H4)), and at its
edge, agyrotropic crescent electron distributions in the plane
perpendicular to the local magnetic field are found due to the
finite gyro-radius effect (Figure 5K). The energy of these
agyrotropic electrons is larger than that of typical sheath
electrons (Figure 2E), which are energized sheath electrons
and/or the electrons originated from the magnetosphere. At
the boundary of the |B] nin region, the gyration of the
electrons after the magnetic curvature scattering forms
crescent electron distributions as well (Figure 5L), and the
energy of these electrons are similar to sheath electrons.
Finally, agyrotropic electron distributions are found on the
magnetospheric side (Figure 5M), where a density gradient is
present. These observed agyrotropic electron distributions not
only support the encounter of the electron diffusion region
vicinity, but also indicate characteristic reconnection features
with weak density and magnetic field asymmetry (Figures 4F,G).

The secondary reconnection re-closes the open magnetic field
lines in the primary exhaust by reconnecting with closed
magnetospheric field lines. The newly closed field lines can
transport plasma in the solar wind into magnetosphere, which
could populate the plasma sheet (e.g., Allen et al., 2017) and even
precipitate in to the ionosphere. In this study, we present auroral
observations in the northern hemisphere from Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/F18 satellite, and
find some bright aurora in the morning sector (Figures 6) as
observed by the on board Special Sensor Ultraviolet
Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) (Paxton et al., 2002). The
magnetic footprint of MMS, marked by a white circle, is also
located at one end of the bright auroral arc/streamer. The
magnetic field used for the MMS footprint tracing includes an
internal IGRF model (Thébault et al., 2015) and an external
Tsyganenko-96 model (Tsyganenko, 1995). Unfortunately, the
DMSP/F18 satellite does not fly over the bright aurora region
(Figures 6A), which prevents direct observations of the particle

precipitation at the bright auroral emissions. Meanwhile, the
dayside auroral intensity is much weaker (Figures 6A), and
the related precipitating ions and electrons observed along the
satellite track are possibly the solar wind origin, as inferred from
their typical energies (Figures 6B). This indicates that the usual
magnetopause reconnection cannot well explain the bright aurora
in the morning ionosphere, and we suggest the secondary
reconnection, which generates earthward propagating plasma
flows in the magnetosphere, can be closely related to the
bright aurora in the morning ionosphere. This relation is

similar to that between the auroral streamer at the nightside
ionosphere and the flow bursts in the magnetotail (Nakamura
et al., 2001; Sergeev et al, 2004). Therefore the secondary
reconnection reported in this study serves to transfer the mass
and energy in the solar wind into geospace. Finally, it is addressed
that the scanning of the bright aurora at the morning ionosphere
is ~ 10 min prior to the flank magnetopause crossing of MMS,
which could bring some errors to the relative locations between
the footprint of MMS and aurora. Considering the solar wind is
relatively stable during this period (Supplementary Figure S1),

the SSUSI instrument in the northern hemisphere on June 1, 2018. The data are shown in the geomagnetic coordinate with noon at the top of the panel. The white circle
marks the magnetic footprint of MMS (MLT: 7.1 h and MLat: 76.8’) and the white dotted line shows the satellite track. (B, C) in situ electron and ion energy spectrum from

this uncertainty for the MMS footprint is about 2° in latitude and
1h in longitude according to the drift speed of the secondary
X-line estimated above, which thus has not been taken into
account here. Based on this point, more observational
assessment should be performed in the future investigations.

3 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In this study, we have presented newly revealed secondary
magnetic reconnection at Earth’s flank magnetopause from
MMS observations. The observed secondary ion jet agrees well
with predictions of magnetic reconnection with a flow shear, and

the electron signatures indicate the encounter of the electron
diffusion region. This secondary reconnection re-closes the open
field lines generated by the primary magnetopause reconnection, so
that it indicates a new pathway for the entry of the solar wind into
the magnetosphere. The re-closure of open field lines by the
reported secondary reconnection, rather than the nightside
magnetotail reconnection, provides an important modification
to the classic Dungey cycle.

The concept of secondary reconnection has been widely proposed
in previous studies (e.g., Daughton et al., 2011; Lapenta et al., 2015;
Fuselier et al., 2017, 2018), but there are some differences existing in
these so-called secondary reconnection. For example, secondary
reconnection can occur in the exhaust region of the primary

reconnection, behaving as an important feature of 3D magnetic
reconnection (Daughton et al., 2011; Lapenta et al., 2015). Both the
primary and secondary reconnection can be found between the
magnetosheath and magnetospheric filed lines, or the magnetic field
lines at two sides of the magnetopause, which can generate flux ropelike structures (Fuselier et al., 2017, 2018). In this study, secondary
reconnection reconnects the previously reconnected open magnetic
field lines with closed magnetospheric field lines (Figure 1A),
resulting into the re-closure of the open field lines. Regarding
this, the reported secondary reconnection, which is found at the
flank magnetopause, is different from other secondary reconnection.

The secondary reconnection here is found at the flank
magnetopause with a large magnetic B, shear, which suggests
that the primary X-line at the flank and the magnetotail current
sheet should not be co-located at the magnetopause (Figure 1A).
In this study, the magnetotail current sheet is twisted due to
interplanetary B, component (T'syganenko, 1998; T'syganenko
and Fairfield, 2004), which leads a substantial offset of the
magnetotail current sheet from the equatorial plane at the
flank region (Supplementary Figure S1). Meanwhile, the
location of the primary magnetopause reconnection is shifted
southward of the equator plane (Figure 3A). This noncolocation of the primary X-line at the flank and the
magnetotail current sheet produces favorable external
conditions for a large magnetic shear, and also the secondary
reconnection. A general description of this non-colocation
should be investigated in the future.

Magnetic reconnection between the open and closed magnetic
field lines is sometimes referred to as the interchange
reconnection. It has been widely applied at the surface of the
Sun, which is responsible for the acceleration of the slow solar
wind (Abbo et al., 2016) and is suggested to play a role in the
generation of magnetic switchbacks (Fisk and Kasper, 2020). The
present finding shows that this type of reconnection also works in
the Earth’s magnetosphere, but behaves as _ secondary
reconnection, as it relies on the generation of open field lines
from the primary reconnection. Therefore the observed
secondary reconnection essentially reflects a cross-scale process
from the global magnetospheric scale to kinetic scales, and we
suggest this reconnection process is applicable to other planets
with similar magnetosphere structures, such as Mercury and
Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede.
