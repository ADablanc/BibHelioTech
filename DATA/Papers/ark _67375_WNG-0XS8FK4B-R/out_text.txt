[1] Shock-crossing data obtained from spacecraft are used to test the shock location
models derived by Chapman and Cairns [2003]. Three sets of data are considered:

(1) ISEE 1 for 24—25 September 1987, (2) Wind, Geotail, IMP 8, and Interball for the
intervals 26—27 April and 10—13 May 1999, and (3) IMP 8, Geotail, Magion-4, and
Cluster during the period 1973—2003 from the bow shock database (available at http://
nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftphelper/bowshock.html). Derived from MHD simulations, the two
shock models are for angles ®0;yyp = 45° and 90° between the upstream magnetic field Bry
and solar wind velocity v,,,. These models have azimuthal asymmetries, and they depend
explicitly on the upstream Mach number M, and ram pressure Pa, We also test Cairns et
al.’s [1995] rotationally symmetric shock model. The new models perform better on
average than the rotationally symmetric model, providing some evidence and support for
the shock’s shape being strongly dependent upon M, and @pypr. We also compare our
analyses here with model/spacecraft comparisons performed by Merka et al. [2003a] and
discuss the importance of filtering on the model predictions. — INDEX TERMS: 2154

1. Introduction

[2] Earth’s bow shock responds to changes in solar wind
conditions by varying its shape and location. These conditions are prescribed by the solar wind ram pressure P,an,
flow velocity v,,, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
vector Byyp, and the Alfvén, sonic, and magnetosonic Mach
numbers M,, Ms, and M,,,,, respectively [e.g., Spreiter et al.,
1966; Fairfield, 1971; Farris et al., 1991; Peredo et al.,
1995; Bennett et al., 1997; Verigin et al., 2001; Fairfield et
al., 2001; Chao et al., 2002; Dmitriev et al., 2003].
Previously, Chapman and Cairns [2003] (hereinafter referred to as CC2003) analyzed shock locations derived from
Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] global three-dimensional (3-D)
ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. These
simulations yielded sets of 3-D shock locations for IMF
orientations 9;yyr = 45° and 90° for multiple , and M,,,..
From these data, shock models were developed describing
the 3-D shape and location of Earth’s bow shock as a
function of Pram, M4, and an azimuthal angle o, using both
paraboloid and tilted paraboloid shape functions. These
analyses show strong evidence for asymmetries in the
shock’s cross section perpendicular to v,,, consistent with
the nonisotropic nature of the fast mode speed. An additional result is that the shock’s symmetry axis tilts away
from the nominal direction (along v,,,) for On4¢ = 45° but
not for O47 = 90°, with these effects becoming increasingly

prevalent as M, — 1. More recently, additional simulations
were performed for several IMF orientations in the ranges
20° < Omar < 60° and 1.4 < My < 9.7 [Chapman et al.,
2004]. They showed that strong skewing effects were larger
for lower M4, with the shock becoming increasingly asymmetric. However, symmetry was recovered for O0yyp = 0°
(although the nose region developed a dimple) and also as
Oimr — 90°. Again, these effects were qualitatively consistent with v,,, being nonisotropic.

[3] This paper involves the comparison of shock locations predicted by the CC2003 3-D models with three data
sets. For completeness a rotationally symmetric paraboloidal model is also compared with the data, described using
Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] model for the shock standoff
distance a, and Cairns et al.’s [1995] model for the
paraboloid flaring parameter b,. Merka et al. [2003a] have
recently compared IMP 8 data obtained over a 12 year
period with a number of different shock models found in
the literature, including the models of Formisano [1979],
Némecek and Safrankova [1991], Farris and Russell
[1994], and Peredo et al. [1995], as well as the rotationally
symmetric paraboloidal model mentioned above [Cairns
and Lyon, 1995; Cairns et al., 1995]. We also compare
our analyses here with model/spacecraft comparisons
performed by Merka et al. [2003a] and discuss the
importance of data filtering on the model predictions.

[4] The first spacecraft data set analyzed here contains
15 shock crossings observed by the ISEE 1 spacecraft
during the period 24—25 September 1987 [Cairns et al.,
1995]. The second data set contains 14 shock crossings

observed in the intervals 26—27 April 1999 and 10-13
May 1999 by the Wind, Geotail, IMP 8, and Interball
spacecraft [Fairfield et al., 2001; D. H. Fairfield, personal
communication, 2000]. In each of these periods the Alfvén
and fast mode Mach numbers were often quite low,
allowing detailed testing of the new shock models. The
third data set contains observed shock crossings from the
IMP 8, Geotail, Magion-4, and Cluster spacecraft for
the interval 1973—2003 (bow shock database available at
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftphelper/bowshock.html). The
IMP 8 data set was also analyzed by Merka et al.
[2003a, 2003b].

[5] This paper is set out as follows. Section 2 summarizes
the new shock models developed by CC2003. In section 3,
coordinate rotations are discussed, together with the methods for comparing the model predictions with data. In
sections 4—7 the spacecraft data are compared with the
model predictions. Section 8 discusses the results, and the
conclusions are given in section 9.

2. New Shock Models

[6] The elliptical paraboloid shock models developed by
CC2003 are relevant for O9,,7 = 45° and 90° and were
derived using the 3-D shock locations found in Cairns and
Lyon’s [1995] ideal MHD simulations. The simulations used
Farris et al.’s [1991] average (B, = 0) 3-D magnetopause
model as a hard, infinitely conducting, inner boundary, with
some solar wind parameters held constant (y = 5/3, v,, =
400 km s~', and My = 7.6) but others allowed to vary (M4,
Om and Byyr). In the simulations, v,,, lies antiparallel to
the x axis, with Byyp lying in the x-z plane.

[7] In the O@p4¢ = 90° simulations the shock’s symmetry
axis remains along the x axis. There is a dependence upon
an azimuthal angle © measured from the z axis in the y-z
plane, with the shock modeled by

er =a, + bsg: (1)

Here a, is the standoff distance of the shock measured along
the Sun-Earth line, and b,, and r, denote the flaring
parameter and the distance to the shock (from the origin (0,
0, 0)), respectively. The standoff distance and terminator
distance (measured in the y-z plane for x = 0) are given by

Equation (7) is only valid in the range 1 < M, < 9.7, since
this empirical relation is derived from the CC2003
simulations which only explored this parameter range. For
M, > 9.7 one would expect that , ~ 0° since the shock is
blown back onto the magnetopause obstacle.

[9] For comparison, Cairns et al.’s [1995] model for b,
only includes a functional dependence upon P,an:

P 1/6
b,(Pram) = 0.0223{ ——"~_ }__R;,!, 8
(Pram) (GF =. & (8)

and the resulting shock is a surface of revolution with a
circular cross section. Cairns and Lyon [1995] found an
expression for a, based on the density jump _X at the shock:

as

= 3.4X (My, Om, M,) + 0.4, (9)
Amp

where d,,,, denotes the magnetopause standoff distance. We
use the analytic expression for the density jump X derived
by Grabbe and Cairns |{1995]. A rotationally symmetric
shock model is compared with the o-dependent models
below, using Cairns et al.’s [1995] model for 6, with Cairns
and Lyon’s [1995] model for a,. In equation (9), values of
Amp are taken from the magnetopause model of Shue et al.
[1997]. This model is also used by Merka et al. [2003a],
allowing a more accurate comparison with their IMP 8
shock-crossing analysis. We discuss the importance of the
magnetopause model in section 8.

3. Rotations and Methods of Testing

in GSE coordinates. To account for aberration due to Earth’s

orbital motion around the Sun, 29.8 km s_! is removed
from the GSE y component of the solar wind velocity v,,,.
To test the models against observed bow shock crossings,
the spacecraft positions are rotated into a coordinate system
in which the new x axis lies along the solar wind vector and
the new z axis is defined so that Bpyp lies in the x-z plane.
This system is defined using the observed solar wind
conditions and IMF vectors and is identical to the coordinate system in the simulations of Cairns and Lyon [1995]
and Chapman et al. [2004], as well as in the CC2003
models presented in section 2.

[11] Spacecraft observations yield the proton number
density n,, the solar wind speed v,,, = (Vx + Vpy + Vo) °
defined by the protons, and Byyr = (Be + B; + By" * asa
function of time. These parameters allow computation of the
Mach numbers and ram pressure of the solar wind after the
number fraction of alpha particles is assumed. On average,
the relative alpha particle abundance, n,/n,, is 4% for the
solar wind [e.g., Slavin and Holzer, 1981; Yermoleav and
Stupin, 1997]. This abundance is assumed in sections 4—6,
and the Alfvén Mach number and ram presure are given by
M4 = Vswr/1.160,,bo/Bime and Pram = 1.160 mVewv» where the
mass density py», = n,m, denotes the mass density of the
solar wind protons.

[12] To test the shock models, the observed solar wind
parameters Pram, M4, and Opyp are used to predict the xm
coordinate of the shock using the rotated spacecraft
coordinates y,. and z,.. Here x} and x0" represent the
x coordinates predicted by the Onyr = 45° (equations (5),
(6), and (7)) and Oy = 90° models (equations (1), (2), and
(4)), respectively. The x”™" coordinates of each model are
compared with the spacecraft coordinate x,. at the times of
the shock crossings. For a model to accurately predict the
shock location the x,. coordinate of the spacecraft must
coincide with the model’s predicted x coordinate. The
prediction x; for a circular cross-sectional paraboloid with
Cairns et al.’s [1995] model (8) for b,(Pram), which does
not include the effects of My, or ©, is also calculated and
used with the prediction (9) for a,.

[13] In comparing the Oyyr = 45° model the correct
orientation is important. In the simulations the 9:y4r = 45°
model applies when B,B, > 0. When B,B, > 0, the shock
tends to flatten over the (+x) — (+z) quadrant, extending
farther in the (+x) — (—z) quadrant. When B,B, < 0, the
model has to be reflected in the x-z plane about the x axis

(or, equivalently, setting z,. = —Z,.) when comparing with
data.

4. ISEE 1 24-25 September 1987 Observations

[14] The bow shock crossed the ISEE | spacecraft multiple times during the period 24—25 September 1987. Plots
of all the solar wind data are given by Cairns et al. [1995].
Figure 1 shows M, and Opyp as a function of time. Data gaps
exist between hours 4 and 12 and between hours 18 and 20.
IMP 8 solar wind data are used to calculate the solar wind
parameters at the times of the ISEE | shock crossings. The
IMP 8 data have been time lagged by 5.6 min to allow for
convection to ISEE 1. The Alfvén Mach number was low
(1 <M, < 3) throughout the period with 50° < On < 90°.

[15] The model predictions for the ISEE 1 shock crossings throughout 24—25 September 1987 are shown in
Figure 2. The models represented by the symbols x; ,
x”, and x, are described in section 2 and in the caption
of Figure 2. The spacecraft trajectories and model predictions are smoothed using a 7.5 min centered running
average. For a model to accurately predict the shock
location the model trace must cross the spacecraft trajectory
Xs at the time of the spacecraft crossing, denoted by the
vertical dash-dotted line. There are two ways of measuring
differences between the model predictions and observations.
The first is to look at the difference between the predicted
coordinates and the spacecraft coordinates at the time of the
shock crossing, 1.e., x2MF oy Alternatively, one can look
at the difference in time between the observed and predicted
shock crossing.

[16] The x; * and 0 models predict the first ISEE 1
crossing (hour 2.75 in Figure 2, top left) within 1 R-z at the
time of the crossing, and the prediction lines cross the
spacecraft trajectory within 3 min. The x; model prediction,
however, only comes within 1 Rg of the spacecraft x,,
coordinate at the time of the crossing and then places the
spacecraft upstream of the shock between hours 2.8 and 3.5.
The x/™* models do, however, mispredict a skimming
crossing near hour 2.2. Plausibly, the spacecraft was very
close to the shock at this time.

[17] The crossing near hour 16.4 is predicted early by
~10 min by the x,> and x7? models and by ~20 min by the
x; model (Figure 2, top right). The two crossings at hours
16.5 and 16.6 are predicted qualitatively, but the quantita

tive differences are significant: They are predicted within
~3 Re for x20" and ~5 R- for the other two models. The
discrepancies for these three crossings may be primarily a
timing issue: Shifting the timelines to the right by 10 min
leads to better prediction for the hour 16.4 crossing and
places the next two crossings on either side of dips in the
prediction line around hour 16.45. It is important that the
shock models used here apply to equilibrium positions of
the shock and so do not include the time lags due to the
shock’s finite propagation speed to its new equilibrium
position. This time lag At is composed of three parts: the
time At,,, = Ax/v,,, for the change in the solar wind
parameters to convect a distance Ax from the spacecraft to
the shock, the time At.) = (@s — Gmp)/Vsw.a for the solar
wind change to reach the magnetopause at the shocked solar
wind speed vy, and the time Ats2 = Ams.new/(Vns — Vsw.d)
for information to propagate back upstream (against the
flow at V,,,¢) to the new shock location at the fast mode
speed Vins:

At = Atsy + Atns.1 + Atns- (10)
The solar wind speed was ~390 km s_' between hours 16
and 17, and assuming that Ax = 3 Rg, ds — Amp © 4 Re,
Ans new © 8 Rey Vsyw.q = 200 km s—', and Vs © 300 km sf,
then At ~ (0.8 + 2.1 + 8.2) min = ‘113 min.

[18] Thus a time lag of the order 10 + 5 min is expected
because of the finite propagation and response speeds, with
longer lags plausible at lower My. Moreover, the 7.5 min
smoothing of the data may also contribute slightly to the
overpredictions, removing biases toward lower predictions.
Finally, the rapid in-out nature of crossings near hours 16.5
and 16.6 and the relatively small changes in the predicted
shock location for the observed solar wind conditions are
qualitatively not inconsistent with a slow response and
therefore slow upstream propagation speed for the shock.
That is, it will take some time for the shock to physically

reach its new equilibrium position in response to changes in
the solar wind. In summary, these two effects can semiquantitatively explain the overpredictions of the shock
models for these data. Additional discussion of the time
lags and mispredictions is given in sections 8.1 and 8.2.

[19] There are very limited data for the two crossings at
hours 18.1 and 18.3, thereby precluding detailed analysis at
these crossings. However, the few data points available
suggest that the model predictions move down toward and
then away from the prediction line, not qualitatively inconsistent with the data.

[20] The first five crossings of the period hours 20—30
(Figure 2, bottom), at hours 21.2, 21.6, 21.9, 22.1, and 22.5,
are predicted within 6 min by all models. The traces of the x;
and x models lie on the spacecraft x, data between hours
22.5 and 23.3, mispredicting the location of the shock.
However, the shock may have been very close to the
spacecraft throughout this period. The x,, model does a
little better (as expected, since Oyp = 80°), placing the
shock earthward of the spacecraft for the period hours
22.5—23, before coinciding with the x,. coordinate between
hours 23 and 23.2. The crossings at hours 24.05 and 25 are
predicted within 3 R-z and ~10 min, respectively, by all
three models. The last crossing at hour 28 is well predicted
by all the models.

5. Observations on 26-27 April 1999

[21] The solar wind parameters measured by the Wind
and IMP 8 spacecraft are shown in Figure 3 for the period
26—27 April 1999. Small measured densities throughout
this interval produced low values of M, — 1. The IMF
orientation stayed at O47 ~ 90° around the times of the
shock crossings. These data (as well as those in section 6
below) are also discussed in detail by Fairfield et al. [2001].
A helium to hydrogen ratio of 4% was assumed because
of the Wind alpha data being unreliable for this period

grey data points indicate measurement by Wind.

(J. Kasper, private communication, 2001). The rotated
trajectory coordinates x, for Wind and IMP 8 are plotted
in Figure 4 (using a 15 min running average to reduce the
scatter), along with the model predictions. The IMP 8 shock
crossings (Figure 4a) occurred at hours 20.4 and 31.0 at the
rotated coordinates (33.4, 4.8, 3.9) Re and (34.5, 8.7, —4.0)
Rp, respectively. All crossings are therefore close to the
nose of the shock. All the models predict the IMP 8 shock
crossings at hours 20.4 and 30.8 within 20 and 2 min,
respectively. However, all three models predict multiple
crossings around hour 11.5 which were not observed
by the spacecraft. Comparing with Figure 3, it is clear that
M, = 1.7 and @nyr = 54°, so that neither of the x2™" models
are exactly appropriate. Noting that the Wind and IMP 8
data predict modestly different values of M4, and so shock
positions, the mispredictions may be due to measurement
issues, fronts of changing solar wind quantities being
neither nonplanar nor aligned with the x axis, or (less
plausibly) time lag effects. These possibilities are discussed
more in sections 6 and 8.

[22] The Wind shocks occurred at hours 25.9 and 30.6
(Figure 4b) at the rotated coordinates, ordered by time, of
(38.5, —20.6, —26.0) Re and (44.9, —8.0, —24.4) Rez,
respectively. A transitory pair of crossings, in which the
Wind spacecraft moved across the shock and back again in

2 min, occurred at hour 22.9, when Wind was at the rotated
coordinates (38.9, —11.4, —29.6) Rg. The x,; 45" and x0"

models predict the time between these crossings near hour
22.9 as 15 min (of order of smoothing time); the x; model
predicts these within ~3 min. The last two Wind crossings
are predicted accurately by all models. Although O0yyr ~ 90°
throughout the times of the IMP 8 and Wind crossings, there
are. few BO thi differences between the predictions of
x and x This lack of observable differences in the
models (e. 6. x versus x; ) is expected since all spacecraft were well upstream of the Earth and a,(Pram, M4) 1s
very similar for both models.

6. Observations on 10-13 May 1999

[23] Figure 5 shows M, and Oy, measured by the Solar
Wind Experiment and Magnetic Field Experiment instruments on board the Wind spacecraft, as a function of time
for the period 10—13 May 1999. As mentioned in section 5,
these data are discussed in detail by Fairfield et al. [2001].
Throughout this period, v,,, ~ 400 kms ~, low densities led
to low measured values of M,, and Oryp lies between 10°
and 90° at the times of the crossings. The data are smoothed
using a 15 min running average. It is noted that there 1s a
data gap between hours 44 and 47.

Figure 5. Alfvén Mach number M, and Onypr as measured by the Wind spacecraft during 10—13 May
1999. Dotted, dashed, dash-dotted, and dot-dot-dot-dashed vertical lines indicate crossings by the
Interball, IMP 8, Wind, and Geotail spacecraft, respectively.

[24] Figure 6 shows the model predictions for the Wind
and Geotail spacecraft. The rotated spacecraft coordinates
X,c and the model predictions are smoothed using a 15 min
running average to reduce the scatter. At hour 16.75 (after
0000 UT on 10 May), Geotail crossed the bow shock at
coordinates (6.6, —6.2, 25.0) Rg. At this time, Wind
measures M, = 5.3 and Op = 50°. All three models predict
the Geotail shock-crossing location within | R; at the time
of the crossing. However, the x; model trace lies on the
spacecraft x,- for the first 8 hours, mispredicting shock
crossings throughout this period. The “hie model traces also
lie close to x,., suggesting that the spacecraft may have been
very close to the shock between hours | and 8.

[25] The two shock crossings observed by the Wind
spacecraft at hours 41.5 and 43.6 are shown in Figure 6b.
At hours 41.5 and 43.6 the spacecraft has the rotated
coordinates (32.2, 23.1, —34.4) Re and (30.3, 4.5, —43.1)
Re, with M, = 1.4 and 1.8 and Onyr = 52° and 56°,
respectively. All three models predict the shock crossing
too early, near hour 37. Fairfield et al. [2001] gave similar
discrepancies for this crossing, attributing them to unreliable density data obtained by Wind preceding the crossing
when Wind was inside the foreshock. As well as this, the
measured densities are so low, ~0.2 cm~? with M@ 4~ 1.3,
that the model predictions are very sensitive to small

changes in density, implying that the large overpredictions
may be due to experimental problems, not problems with
the models.

[26] All three models accurately predict the second Wind
shock crossing at hour 43.6. The lack of data after the
crossing at hour 43.6 makes it impossible to determine
where the models place the shock. All models incorrectly
predict the shock moving over the spacecraft at hours 48
and 50.

[27] Figure 7 compares the models with the Interball
and IMP 8 shock crossings. For the Interball crossings
the spacecraft was at the rotated coordinates (19.2, 14.6,
0.0) Re and (16.2, —4.3, 1.5) Rz at hours 24.9 and 62.3,
with M, = 2.9 and 4.0 and Or = 27 and 94, respectively. The first Interball crossing is predicted early at
hour 22, not inconsistent with the simulations showing
smaller a, for smaller O;ye [Chapman et al., 2004]. The
second crossing is predicted within 1 R; by all models.
During this crossing, no large differences exist between
the models since we are at the nose of shock, and we can
only expect to observe small differences in the predicted
values for a,.

[28] The four IMP 8 crossings (Figure 7b) occurred at
hours 35.3, 49.9, 57.3, and 59.0 when M, = 1.6, 2.5, 2.0,
and 2.0 and Onyr = 54.6, 57.5, 55.8, and 42.2, respectively.

The rotated coordinates of the four shock crossings, in order
of increasing time, are (25.9, —18.3, 28.2) Rez, (20.3, —31.6,
20.8) Re, (22.1, 7.1, 36.1) Re, and (6.3, —32.9, —26.8) Rz.
The predictions of x,, , x,; , and x; all overpredict the first
crossing (hour 35.3) by a considerable amount, first crossing the spacecraft line at hour 32 (3.3 hours early). The
measured density and Mach number for this crossing are
low (Ny, = 0.34 cm °, M, ~ 1.67, and Ms = 5.7), as they are
also in the 2—3 hours preceding the crossing. This suggests
again that the reason for the misprediction is the high
sensitivity of the models for small M, and n,,,. As well as
this the shock was moving outward, implying that the
equilibrium position could be farther out (larger x coordinate) than that observed. The model predictions are for
static or equilibrium positions of the shock, and since the
shock itself is moving, this difference could explain some of
the discrepancy between the predicted and observed shock
location.

[29] The second IMP 8 shock crossing, caused by a
sudden inward motion, is well predicted by the xe and
x, models, as shown by the model lines dipping rapidly to
cross the trajectory at hour 49.9. However, the models
mispredict a crossing at hour 52, and the crossing at hour
57.3 is predicted too early but within 1 hour of the observed
crossing. Fairfield et al. [2001] obtain similar time discrepancies, attributing this to spatial variations in the solar wind
between the IMP 8 and Wind spacecraft, which could cause
a misprediction of | hour at Wind. The last crossing is
predicted accurately by the xP ” and 20" models. The x;
model with 5, = b,(Pram) only works well for the first three
IMP 8 crossings and does not predict the last crossing (x;
lies below the IMP 8 trajectory line). This model also
mispredicts crossings between hours 42 and 47.

7. Bow Shock Database Data

[30] In this section we present shock data obtained from
the online bow shock database (available at http://nssdc.
esfc.nasa.gov/ftphelper/bowshock.html). The observational
periods for the data sets are as follows: 1973—2000 for IMP
8, 1996-1997 for Magion-4, 2001—2002 for Cluster, and
1995-1997 for Geotail. The solar wind parameters are
available for each specific spacecraft, appropriate for testing
with the shock models. The IMP 8 database has additional
observational flag parameters, and only those shock cross
ings are selected which are unambiguous in all the available data and where all required data are available. All data
have been filtered with 300 km s_' < vy, < 500 kms,
1 < M, < 10, and 4 < M, < 10. These filters led to 648
crossings by IMP 8, 210 by Magion-4, 227 by Cluster, and
145 by Geotail.

[31] By analogy with the analyses by Merka et al. [2003a],
in Figure 8 we show the ratio Ryrode/Rops, Where Rmodel =
/x2, +2 +22 and Rops = \/x2, + v2, + 22, are the distance
of the shock from Earth as given by the model predictions
and measured by the spacecraft, respectively. For each
spacecraft the ratios were obtained by binning the data into
intervals of Oy and then averaging over all values of Rmodei/
Rops in that bin for each model. A ratio of 1 implies a perfect
prediction on average with Rinode = Robs, and we have
plotted a horizontal dotted line at Rmode/Rovs = 1.

[32] On average the xr models do very well for all four
spacecraft with 1 < |Rmode/Robs| < 1.058 + 0.002 for the
range 40° < Onyr < 140° where these models are
appropriate. More specifically, the x9" models are only in
error by 2% for IMP 8 (for 60° < Oi < 140°), 5% for
Geotail and Cluster, and 2% for Magion-4. Outside this
range the model predictions worsen on average, which is to
be expected since the models are outside their domain of
applicability and asymmetries in the shock increase as Om
decreases (20° < Onyp < 40° and 140° < Onyp < 180°)
[Chapman et al., 2004]. Differences exist in the predictive
capabilities of the x; and xSiMe models in the Magion-4 and
Cluster results. For example, the x; model overestimates the
shock locations by up to 20% of the Cluster data for the 80°
< Orr < 100° bin, whereas the x SiMe models are within 4% of
a perfect prediction. Similar comparisons can be made in the
other Oy bins, as well as in the Magion-4 data, with the x;
model doing worse on average.

[33] Figure 9 shows similar comparisons in which the
shock crossings are separated into M, bins. Here the x7""
models are only in error by 7% for IMP 8, 6% for
Magion-4, 4% for Geotail, and 6% for Cluster (but only in
the range 4 < M, < 10). Again, the x; model shows larger
differences then the other models between the observed and
predicted values for the Magion-4 and Cluster spacecraft.

L341] Differences between the predictive capabilities of the
x and x2" models are not obvious in Figures 8 and 9. To
observe the geometric effects predicted for the models (seen
in the simulations of Chapman et al. [2004]), such as the

tilting or flattening of the shock in x-z planes for the x

model in contrast to the shock’s symmetric shape in the x,,
model, the shock crossings need to be observed in specific
planes. For instance, in the y-z plane the shock should be
flattened over the +z quadrants for oblique IMF, and
noncircular cross sections are expected for all Oty
[Chapman et al., 2004]. One problem with this is that
multiple shock crossings are required for low enough M,
where these effects are prominent and easily observed. Only
the IMP 8 database contains enough crossings for statistically significant analyses to be performed. In Figure 10 the
IMP 8 shock-crossing coordinates (),., Z,-) are plotted for
My, <5, On < 80°, One > 100°, and spacecraft locations
—10 Re <x. < 12 Re, regimes where tilting or skewing of
the shock is possible [Chapman et al., 2004; CC2003].
These restrictions leave 56 shock crossings. In this data set,
6% of the data have M, < 3, and the other 94% are in the
range 3 < M, < 5. The fit in Figure 10 shows a shifted
ellipse, in analogy with Figure 8 of CC2003, of the form
Y°/A* + (z + z)/B* = 1. The fit was performed with free
parameters A, B, and Zo, yielding a shift in the cross section
along z of 26 + 0.52 Rz (1.e., Zo = —2.6 + 0.52 Re). This
is consistent with the shock models which predict a shift

“Bie

in the z coordinate of the centroid in the range 1.8—4.8 Rz
for 2 < M, < 5 (see CC2003, Figure 8).

[35] To test for b,. effects (or elliptical cross-sectional
effects), the IMP 8 data for 5 < M, < 10 are shown in Figure
11. A nonshifted elliptical fit to the data of the form Y?/A* +

z’/B? = 1 has the semimajor axis lying along the y axis and
is 4.5 + 0.9% larger (L,/L, = 0.92) than the semiminor axis
along z. This implies an ecoentricity of 0.4, consistent with
those observed in the simulations of CC2003 for M, ~ 5
(see CC2003, Figure 7). These two effects, the shift of the
centroid of the cross section for 2 < M, < 5 and the
noncircular cross sections for 5 < M, < 10, are both
qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the results of
CC2003 and Chapman et al. [2004] (see also the discussion
in section 8.3).

8. Discussion
8.1. Time Lag Effects

[36] The shock models describe the equilibrium positions
of the shock, but the shock crossings in sections 4—6 are
measured as the shock moves over the spacecraft (any
movement of the spacecraft 1s negligible compared with

crossings are early, and almost all (10 of 11) inbound
crossings are on time. The only on-time outbound crossing
was for the high M,(~5.5) Geotail crossing at hour 16.75
(10—13 May 1999). There is a clear correlation in Table 2:
Early model predictions are produced for outbound, low M4
shocks, and the on-time predictions occur for inbound
shocks. This can be explained qualitatively in terms of the
time lags for the propagation of information from the solar
wind to the magnetopause and then back upstream to the
shock, as described in equation (10). For an outbound shock
the time lag should be larger for lower My, since the
propagation distances for which the information must travel
become greater (e.g., A,,,, increases as M, decreases) and the
relative speed (Vins — Vsw,a)/Vsw becomes smaller. For inbound shocks, in contrast, the shock plausibly moves to its
new equilibrium position at v,,, in a time + Ax/¥,,.

8.2. Systematic Effects

[37] The x*“? and x; models describe the equilibrium
position of the shock and do not include several effects.
First, they do not take into account the finite propagation
speed of the shock. The solar wind conditions at any given
time are used in the models to predict the instantaneous
location of the shock; however, it will take time for the
shock to physically reach its new equilibrium position. So,
for example, the early prediction of an outward moving
shock (due to My, or Pram decreasing, e.g., or Omer
changing), or the late prediction of an inward moving
shock, is potentially due to the finite time required for the
shock to reach the new equilibrium position. The early
predictions of the outbound crossings in sections 4—6, for
example, the multiple ISEE 1 crossings in Figure 2 (hours
16.4, 21.6, 22.1, and 25.0) and the first IMP 8 crossing at
hour 35.3 in Figure 7b, could be due to this time lag effect.

[38] Second, the x2™" shock models are very sensitive to
changes in the solar wind conditions when the density is
low enough such that 1 < M, < 2. For these conditions,
changes between the model predictions and observations are
amplified because of the 1/M% dependence (see, e.g., the
shock crossing of Wind at hour 41.5 in Figure 6).

[39] Third, there is also the possibility that time-dependent changes in the shock’s shape are important. The
shock’s shape may not change smoothly to the new equilibrium position as the shock adjusts in a time-dependent
fashion. For instance, large-scale time-dependent ripples in
the magnetopause structure due to changes in P,.,, have
been reported in simulations [e.g., Smith, 1991, Figure 5],
which could have counterparts in the shock’s location and
geometry, thereby causing the model predictions to differ
significantly from observation.

CHAPMAN AND CAIRNS: MODELING OF EARTH’S BOW SHOCK—APPLICATIONS

A11202

[40] Fourth, the abundance of helium may also cause
changes in the model predictions, since larger values of n,/
n, lead to larger pressure and Mach numbers, thereby
reducing the x coordinate of the model predictions. However, these changes are relatively small on the basis of our
calculations. Here we have assumed that n,/n, = 0.04, since
the helium abundances were not available for all times of
the shock crossings. A larger abundance of, say, 10% leads
to variations of a few Earth radii in the model predictions.
For example, changing n,/n, to 10% from 4% implies an
increase Of P,a, and M, by 20% and 10%, respectively. So,
for a low M, shock with M, = 2 and n/n, = 4%, My
becomes 2.2 when n,/n, = 10%. This implies a decrease in
a, from equation (2) of ~1 Rg, and the P, we scaling
introduces a further reduction by 2% as well. The total
effect is to reduce the original values by only 7%, which
results in a displacement of only ~1.6 Rg for a low M, ~ 2
shock. As M, increases, this becomes less important since
the models are less sensitive to changes in M, at high M,.

[41] Fifth, the simulations of Cairns and Lyon [1995],
used to develop the new shock models tested here, represent
the magnetopause obstacle using Farris et al.’s [1991] mean
magnetopause model. This model assumes axial symmetry
of the magnetopause and does not contain possible changes
in shape and location due to magnetic reconnection [e.g.,
Farris et al., 1991; Sibeck et al., 1991]. In addition, ring
current effects on the magnetopause location are not
included [e.g., Formisano et al., 1971]. As suggested by
CC2003, the model parameters a, and b,., could be rescaled
using a different magnetopause model, similar to those
of Verigin et al. [2001, 2003] and Fairfield et al. [2001].
This has been attempted (plots not shown here). However,
there was negligible improvement in the model predictions
for x" and so we suggest using the original unscaled
version of the model for simplicity.

8.3. Review of Model Results

[42] Having now discussed the effects that may lead to
differences between the model results and observations, we
now review the models’ performance. The x”™" models
perform well in predicting the shock’s location, with the x;
model performing slightly worse on average. Specifically,
out of a total of 29 shock crossings in sections 4—6, 24 were
predicted within either 1 hour and/or 5 Rpg by the x)
models, and only 21 were predicted by the x; model. A total
of 5 of 29 were not predicted by the model trace actually
crossing the spacecraft trajectory but were predicted
qualitatively; that is, the model lines moved toward and
away from the spacecraft trajectory in the appropriate way
(see, e.g., the ISEE | crossings between hours 16 and 19 in
Figure 2). The x" models mispredict four shock crossings
where there were none observed (three of these are
mispredicted by the x; model also), with a total of five
mispredictions for the x; model. Thus the x'™F_ models
perform better then the x; model: The number of crossings
accurately predicted is greater by three, and the number of
mispredictions are fewer by one, supporting the use of the
CC2003 models. As well as this both elementary theory and
MHD simulations demonstrate that the shock’s 3-D shape,
not just the nose location, should vary strongly with MZ), so
it is expected that the x*™F models do better then the x;
model. Large differences in the xP * and x20" models are not

10 of 12
A11202

observed in many of the crossings when spacecraft were
near the nose of the shock, especially when the x,,
coordinates were large (with [y,.|, |Zs-| < 10 Rez).

[43] The analyses performed on the bow shock database
in Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate very good accuracy, on
average, for the x/™" models. Having a large number of
shock crossings allows for a more statistically significant
comparison with the models, since some shock behaviors
not explicitly included in the the models will average out
and therefore will not affect the results. For example,
problems with the finite propagation speed likely average
out, with the data set containing just as many inward
moving shocks as outward moving ones. Indeed, the models
perform very well in the range 60° < 80; < 140° in Figure 8
and 1 < M, < 10 for the IMP 8, Magion-4, Cluster, and
Geotail spacecraft, with the x!“ models predicting the
shock position within a few percent on average. This
compares very favorably with the case studies in sections
4—6. The x; model performs significantly worse for the
Magion-4 and Cluster data, thereby suggesting that changes
in shape (6,) with M, are important.

[44] Recently, Merka et al. [2003a] compared six bow
shock models with IMP 8 data from the bow shock
database. Their analysis favored three models in the literature: the models of Formisano [1979], Farris and Russell
[1994], and Cairns and Lyon [1995] (equivalent to the x;
model shown here), with each performing equivalently well.
The analyses contained in section 7 contain some statistical
differences from those of Merka et al. [2003a]. Direct
comparisons with Figures 5 and 6 of Merka et al.
[2003a], which contain Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] model
comparisons, show different trends in the ratio Ryode/Robs
for the M, < 4.5 bin (Figure 5) and the Ohyqp < 20 and OpypF >
160 bins (Figure 6). Where we obtain a ratio Rinode/Robs < |
and ~1 for the low Op and M, criterion, respectively,
Merka et al. [2003a] obtain ratios of Rinode/Robs > 1 and <1.
These statistical differences are due to different sampling of
the data as described below.

[45] First, the analyses shown in the paper use the
extended IMP 8 database for crossings between 1973 and
2000, whereas Merka et al. [2003a] use the IMP 8 data for
the period 1973-1999, with crossings observed between
1973—1981 and 1981-1999. Before filtering the data the
extended IMP 8 database contains ~11,000 crossings,
whereas the Merka et al. [2003a] analysis relied upon
~4500 crossings. After removing the ambiguous crossings,
Merka et al. [2003a] were left with ~2300 crossing,
whereas the extended database contains ~5000 unambiguous crossings. However, after performing the rotation of the
crossings to compare with the models and after applying the
filters on the upstream conditions as described in section 7,
the filtered extended database contains only 10% more
crossings than that of the filtered data set in the range
1973—1999 and so does not add any large statistical differences between the two data sets. Moreover, Merka et al.
[2003c] have redone their analysis using the extended
database and showed that their results are qualitatively the
same as those of Merka et al. [2003a]. Second, as described
in section 7, the data were filtered with limits on the
upstream parameters v,,,, M,, and M, (leaving 648 crossings) so that the CC2003 models were applicable. Merka et
al. [2003a] do not impose similar restrictions on these

CHAPMAN AND CAIRNS: MODELING OF EARTH’S BOW SHOCK—APPLICATIONS

A11202

parameters (leaving 2293 crossings) but instead bin or filter
the data one parameter at a time (see their Figures 4—6).
This leads to differences between the analyses here and
those of Merka et al. [2003a].

[46] One set of filters imposed by Merka et al. [2003a]
are for the relatively nominal solar wind conditions Ms; >
4.5, M,>4, and 45° < Ony4p < 135°, for which they obtained
a ratio Rinodel/Robs © 0.96 + 0.10 (estimated from Merka et
al. [2003a, Figure 6]) for Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] model.
Looking at the plots here with 45° < Op4p < 135° in Figure 8
and M, > 4 in Figure 9, the average ratios are ~0.99 + 0.10.
These are consistent within the errors bars. Moreover, we
confirm that we obtain similar trends to the Merka et al.
[2003a] analyses when redoing the analysis using their
filtering. The tendency to overpredict or underpredict the
shock location is thus sensitive to the bins or filtering used.
We reiterate that the filtering we use is intended to directly
test models derived from the simulations of CC2003 which
were based upon specific solar wind conditions.

[47] Our analyses here improve significantly, on average,
upon Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] model, suggesting that the
new shock models may also outperform Formisano’s
[1979] and Farris and Russell’s [1994] models (and the
three other models tested by Merka et al. [2003a]). The x SiMe
models are based upon MHD simulations and so contain the
expected theoretical dependencies of shock shape (M, and
©), as well as nose location, upon the upstream solar wind
conditions, and so it is expected that the x?’ models
perform better.

[48] Support for the modeled cross-sectional asymmetries, described by the © dependence of b,, are shown in
Figures 10 and 11. The translated cross section (Figure 10)
is qualitatively consistent with CC2003 as well as the
observations of Verigin et al. [2001] and the analytic bow
shock work of Verigin et al. [2003]. In addition, the
translation of the centroid by —2.6 Rz along z is quantitatively consistent with the x?’ models, which predict a
translation of ~1.8—4.8 R» for 2 < M, <5 with Omnyp = 45°
[Chapman et al., 2004; CC2003]. For the elliptical fit in
Figure 11 the ratio L,/L, = 0.92 gives a cross-sectional
eccentricity of 0.4 which is consistent with Figure 7 of
CC2003 and the 2—7% asymmetries measured by Peredo et
al. [1995]. Note, however, that the model of Peredo et al.
[1995] has at least a 20% bias [Merka et al., 2003a]. The
shifting of the shock’s cross section is difficult to observe in
the near-Earth regime, as was seen from the rather similar
predictions for the x; and m"™* models in sections 4—6. The
maximum cross-sectional asymmetry for the x7,” model, for
example, occurs at « ~ 0.4 for M, ~ 2 (see CC2003,
Figure 7), which corresponds to differences in the extent of
the shock in the terminator plane (x = 0) of ~4 Rez. Thus,
in the near-Earth regime we can only expect a maximum difference between o-dependent and symmetric
paraboloidal models of ~4 R;. These differences would
be more pronounced farther downstream of Earth.

9. Conclusion

[49] The CC2003 models, for 8p4¢ = 45° and 90°, which
predict the location of Earth’s bow shock based upon MHD
simulations, have been tested with observational data. The
results show that the models perform well against the data.

Comparisons with Cairns and Lyon’s [1995] rotationally
symmetric model show that the x”™* models do better on
average in locating the shock. The two main features of the
model, flaring of the shock and shifting of the shock’s cross
section for 947 = 45° due to dependences of the shock
shape on My, azimuthal angle o, and Qyp, are both
supported.
