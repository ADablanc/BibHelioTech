ABSTRACT

The first computation of the compressible energy transfer rate from ~ 0.2 AU up to
~ 1.7 AU is obtained using PSP, THEMIS and MAVEN observations. ‘The compressible energy cascade rate €¢ is computed for hundred of events at different heliocentric
distances, for time intervals when the spacecraft were in the pristine solar wind. ‘The
observational results show moderate increases of €¢ with respect to the incompressible
cascade rate €;. Depending on the level of compressibility in the plasma, which reach
up to 25 % in the PSP perihelion, the different terms in the compressible exact relation
are shown to have different impact in the total cascade rate ¢g. Finally, the observational results are connected with the local ion temperature and the solar wind heating
problem.

1. INTRODUCTION

Turbulence is a unique nonlinear phenomenon in fluid and plasma flows that allows the transfer
of the energy between different scales. ‘Turbulence plays a major role in controlling the dynamical
features of many astrophysical plasmas such as accretion disks, star formation, solar wind heating,
or energy transport in planetary magnetospheres (e.g., Balbus & Hawley 1998; Schekochihin et al.
2009; Hennebelle & Falgarone 2012; Federrath & Klessen 2012; Tao et al. 2015; Kritsuk et al. 2017;

Huang et al. 2020a,b; Sorriso-Valvo et al. 1999). Thanks to the availability of in situ measurements
from various orbiting spacecraft, the solar wind provides a unique opportunity to investigate plasma
turbulence (Sahraoui et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020a; Andrés et al. 2019; Huang
& Sahraoui 2019; Hadid et al. 2018; Kiyani et al. 2015; Alexandrova et al. 2013; Howes et al. 2012;
Osman et al. 2011). A long-established challenge in the solar wind community is the so-called

heating problem. It is manifested by the fact that the solar wind proton temperature decreases
slowly as a function of the radial distance from the Sun, in comparison to the prediction of the
adiabatic expansion model of the solar wind (Marsch et al. 1982; Vasquez et al. 2007; Pine et al.
2020). While several scenarios have been proposed to explain those observations (see, Matthaeus
et al. 1999; Marsch 1991) the main candidate is certainly the local heating of the solar wind plasma
via the turbulent cascade (Bruno & Carbone 2005; Matthaeus & Velli 2011). In this picture, the
energy that is injected at the largest scales in the solar wind will cascade within the inertial range,
until it reaches the dissipation scales, where it is eventually converted into the thermal heat of the
plasma particles (see, Sahraoui et al. 2020; Kiyani et al. 2015). This framework has led to several
investigations to estimate the energy cascade rate in the solar wind at different scales and different
heliocentric distances using theoretical, numerical and observational strategies.

The first theoretical exact relation (or law) for incompressible hydrodynamics (HD) turbulence
was derived from the von-Kérman-Howarth dynamical equation (von Karman & Howarth 1938)
and represents one of the very few exact results in turbulence theories (Frisch 1995). Under the
assumption of homogeneity and full isotropy, the so-called 4/5 law (Kolmogorov 1941a,b) predicts
a linear scaling for the longitudinal third-order structure function of the velocity field with the

distance between points. This exact relation (valid only in the inertial range) gives an expression for
the energy dissipation or cascade rate € as a function of the structure functions of the turbulent fields
(see, e.g. Monin & Yaglom 1975, and references therein). Galtier & Banerjee (2011) and Banerjee &
Galtier (2014) generalized this exact result to compressible HD turbulence within the isothermal and

polytropic approximations, respectively. The authors have found the presence of a new term that
acts in the inertial range as a source (or a sink) for the mean energy cascade rate, in contrast with
incompressible HD turbulence, where only flux terms act to transfer energy in the inertial range.
Numerical results of supersonic isothermal HD turbulence have shown that these new source terms
are smaller than the flux terms in the inertial range (Kritsuk et al. 2013).

The first generalization of these exact relations to a magnetized plasma was made by Politano
& Pouquet (1998a,b) using the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. The validity
of this exact result has been subjected to several numerical tests using direct numerical simulations
(DNSs) of MHD turbulence (see, e.g. Mininni & Pouquet 2009; Boldyrev et al. 2009; Wan et al. 2010).
Moreover, the exact law has been used to estimate the energy cascade rate (Sorriso-Valvo et al. 2007;
Sahraoui 2008; Coburn et al. 2015) and the magnetic and kinetic Reynolds numbers (Weygand et al.
2007) in solar wind turbulence, and in large scale modeling of the solar wind (Matthaeus et al. 1999;

MacBride et al. 2008). Banerjee & Galtier (2013) derived an exact law for a two-point correlation
functions of the fields for isothermal compressible MHD turbulence, and was expressed in terms of
flux or source terms. Recently, Andrés & Sahraoui (2017) revisited that work and provided a new
derivation using the classical plasma variables, i.e., the plasma density and velocity field and the

compressible Alfvén speed. The new expression reported in Andrés & Sahraoui (2017) showed four
types of terms that are involved in the nonlinear cascade: the hybrid and 6-dependent terms, in
COMPRESSIBLE SOLAR WIND TURBULENCE 3

addition to well-known flux and source terms (see, Andrés & Banerjee 2019; Ferrand et al. 2020). It
is this latter formulation that we shall use in the present study.

From the observational viewpoint, using a reduced form of the exact relation for compressible MHD
turbulence and in situ measurements from the ‘Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions
during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft (Auster et al. 2009), Banerjee et al. (2016) and Hadid et al.
(2017) have studied the role of compressibility in the energy cascade of the solar wind turbulence.
The authors found a more prominent role of density fluctuations in amplifying the energy cascade
rate in the slow than in the fast solar wind. Another interesting feature that has been evidenced in the
Earth’s magnetosheath is that density fluctuations reinforce the anisotropy of the energy cascade rate
with respect to the local magnetic field (Hadid et al. 2018) and increase the cascade rate as it enters
into the sub-ion scales (Andrés et al. 2019). Recently, using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations
during the first encounter, Bandyopadhyay et al. (2020) have computed the incompressible energy
transfer rate between 55 and 35 solar radius. Their findings showed that the incompressible energy
cascade rate obtained near the first perihelion is about 100 times higher than the average value
at 1 AU (e.g., Sorriso-Valvo et al. 2007; Hadid et al. 2017). Moreover, Andrés et al. (2020) have
computed the first estimation of the incompressible energy cascade rate at the MHD scales in the
plasma upstream of the Martian bow shock (at ~ 1.38 — 1.67 AU). Using Mars Atmosphere and
Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) observations, the authors found that the nonlinear cascade of energy
at the MHD scales is slightly amplified when proton cyclotron waves are present in the plasma.

However, in all those recent cases only the incompressible cascade rate was estimated.

The main goal of the present paper is to generalize and extend previous observational studies using
a more complete theory of turbulence to investigate the compressible energy cascade rate €c at the
MHD scales at different heliocentric distances. In particular, we use 3 data sets, the observations
from PSP at ~ 0.2 - 0.4 AU, THEMIS around ~ 1 AU, and MAVEN at ~ 1.5 - 1.7 AU. The paper
is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the compressible MHD set of equations and recall
briefly the main steps to derive the exact laws for fully developed compressible MHD turbulence
(and its incompressible limit). In section 3, we present the three observations sets and the selection
criteria used in the present work. Finally, in section 4 we discuss our main observational results and
their physical implications on solar wind turbulence.

2. THEORETICAL MODEL
2.1. Compressible MHD equations

The three-dimensional (3D) compressible MHD equations are the continuity equation for the mass
density p, the momentum equation for the velocity field u, in which the Lorentz force is included, the
induction equation for the magnetic field B, and the differential Gauss’ law. These equations can be
written as (see, e.g., Marsch & Mangeney 1987; Andrés et al. 2017),

A =u Ve— 20 -u, (1)
Ou 1

7 Vat ua: Vua — ov (P+ Pu) — Ua ua) + fe + de, (2)
O08 = a uy buy Vu 280 a) +n +d (3)

ua: Vo + 20(V - ua) = 0, (4)
4 ANDRES ET AL.

where we have defined the compressible Alfvén velocity ua = B//47p. In this manner, both
field variables, u and ua, are expressed in speed units. For the sake of simplicity we assume that
the plasma follows an isothermal equation of state, i.e, P = c2p, where c, is the sound speed

(temperature dependent), which allows us to close the hierarchy of the fluid equations (no energy
equation is further needed). Note that Py = pu4/2 is the magnetic pressure and that the continuity
equation (1) is written as a function of the internal compressible energy for an isothermal plasma,

i.e., € = ci In(p/po), where po is a constant (of reference) mass density. Finally, f,., are respectively
a mechanical and the curl of the electromotive large-scale forcings, and dz, are respectively the
small-scale kinetic and magnetic dissipation terms.

2.2. Exact relation in compressible MHD turbulence

Using Eq. (1)-(4) and following the usual assumptions for fully developed homogeneous turbulence

(i.e., infinite kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers and a steady state with a balance between
forcing and dissipation (Galtier & Banerjee 2011; Banerjee & Kritsuk 2018), an exact relation for
compressible MHD turbulence can be obtained as,

i
—2EC = 5 Ve Bo t+8ct+8u t+ Mg, (5)

where €¢ is the total compressible energy cascade rate and Fc, 5c, 5q and Mg, represent the total
compressible flux, source, hybrid and 6-dependent terms, respectively (for a detailed derivation see,
Andrés & Sahraoui 2017). These terms are defined as,

Fo = ({((6(pu) - du+ 6(pua,) - dualou — [d(pu) - dug + Ou - d(pu, )|Ou,)

+ 2(dedpdu), (6)
So = ((Rp— 5(Ry + Ro)|(V-u) + [Re — 5(Ro + Rp)|(V"-w)

+ ((Bu ~ Rhy) ~ plu’ us) (Va)

+ [(Riy — Run) — plu ui))(V"- wy), 7)
SxH= (A _ E'\(V -u) + = Pe E)(V' -w’))

+5((e +“) [V- (ou)] + (e+ 2) [W"-(o'w))). (8)
Ms = —5(8-"'V'- (pu) + 6'V- (ep'w)), (9)

where we have defined the total energy (i.e., the free energy) and the density-weighted cross-helicity
per unit volume respectively as,

E(x) = 5(u- w+ ua: Ua) + pe, (10)
H(x) = p(w ua), (1)
COMPRESSIBLE SOLAR WIND TURBULENCE is)

and their associated two-point correlation functions as,

Re(x,x’) = E(u ul + uy uh) + pe, (12)
Ru(x,x’) = S(u- uly + ua), (13)
Re(x,x!) = F(ua- uh). (14)

In all cases the prime denotes field evaluation at x’ = x + @ (€ being the displacement vector) and
the angular bracket (-) denotes an ensemble average. It is worth mentioning that the properties of
spatial homogeneity implies (assuming ergodicity) that the results of averaging over a large number of
realizations can be obtained equally well by averaging over a large region of space for one realization
(Batchelor 1953). In analysis of spacecraft data this generally amounts to time averaging based on
the Taylor hypothesis (e.g., Taylor 1938a,b; Huang & Sahraoui 2019; Treumann et al. 2019). We
have introduced the usual increments and local mean definitions, i.e., da = a’ —a and @ = (a’+a)/2
(with a any scalar or vector function), respectively. Finally, we recall that the derivation of the exact
law (5) does not require the assumption of isotropy and that it is independent of the dissipation
mechanisms acting in the plasma (assuming that the dissipation acts only at the smallest scales in
the system) (see also, Galtier & Banerjee 2011; Andrés et al. 2016b,a).

The quantity in Eq. (6) is associated with the energy flux, and is the usual term present in the
exact law of incompressible turbulence (Politano & Pouquet 1998a). This term is written as a global
divergence of products of increments of different variables. It is worth mentioning that the total
compressible flux (6) is a combination of two terms of different nature, a Yaglom-like term,

Fic = ({(6(pu) - du+ 6(pua) - dualou — [d(pu) - dua + du- d(pug)|ouay), (15)

which is the compressible generalization of the incompressible term (see, Politano & Pouquet
1998a,b), and a new purely compressible flux term,

Foc = 2(dpdedu), (16)

which is a new contribution to the energy cascade rate due to the presence of density fluctuations in
the plasma (see, Banerjee & Galtier 2013; Andrés & Sahraoui 2017).

The purely compressible source terms in Eq. (7), i.e. those proportional to the divergence of the
Alfvén and kinetic velocity fields (and involve the two-point correlation functions Rz, Rg and Ry),
may act as a source (or a sink) for the mean energy cascade rate in the inertial range. The hybrid
term offers the freedom to be written either as a flux- or as a source-like term. However, when
written as a flux-like term it cannot be expressed as the product of increments, as the classical flux
in incompressible HD and MHD turbulence (von Karman & Howarth 1938; Kolmogorov 1941a,b;
Chandrasekhar 1951; Politano & Pouquet 1998a,b) or their counterparts in Eq. (6). The mixed
6-dependent term (transformed into a flux-like term in Banerjee & Galtier (2013) under certain
conditions) has no counterpart in compressible HD turbulence (Galtier & Banerjee 2011; Banerjee &
Galtier 2014) and cannot, in general, be expressed as purely flux or source term. It is worth recalling
that these three type of terms can be estimated only using multi-spacecraft data and techniques,
since them include local vector divergences (Andrés et al. 2019). However, numerical results for
6 ANDRES ET AL.

supersonic and subsonic for HD and MHD turbulence show that these terms are negligible in the
inertial range (Kritsuk et al. 2013; Andrés et al. 2018). Therefore, in the present paper, to estimate
the compressible energy cascade rate (5), we shall consider only the flux terms (15) and (16).

Assuming statistical isotropy, we can integrate Eq. (5) over a sphere of radius @ to obtain a scalar
relation for isotropic turbulence. In compact form Eq. (5) can be cast as,

4
—gecl = Fic + Fre, (17)
where Fo; + Foe = (Foi + Fee) - V ous is the flux term projected into the mean plasma flow velocity
field V... ‘Ihe incompressible limit is easily recovered for p > po,

4
—ge1l = Fy, (18)

where F; is the projection of F; = po([(du)? + (6B)*?]du — 2(6u- 5B)dB) along the mean plasma flow
velocity field. Equation (18) corresponds to the exact relation for fully developed IMHD turbulence
(see, Politano & Pouquet 1998a,b). Here B is expressed in velocity units and €; is the incompressible
energy cascade rate. One can note that F; depends only on the increments of the magnetic (and
velocity) field, although the total magnetic field has been considered in the derivation. Finally,
assuming the Taylor hypothesis (i.e, V7 = 2, where V is the mean plasma flow speed), Eqs. (17)
and (18) can be expressed as a function of time lags T.

3. SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS AND SELECTION CRITERIA

In order to analyze the solar wind turbulence at different heliocentric distances, our data intervals
for PSP and THEMIS/MAVEN were divided into a series of samples of equal duration of 30 and 35
minutes, respectively. ‘This particular time duration ensures having at least one correlation time of
the turbulent fluctuations for each particular heliocentric distance (see, Hadid et al. 2017; Marquette
et al. 2018; Parashar et al. 2020). Moreover, we avoid intervals that contained significant disturbances
or large-scale gradients (e.g., coronal mass ejection or interplanetary shocks). We further considered
only intervals that did not show large fluctuations of the energy cascade rate over the MHD scales,
typically we retained events with std(¢;)/mean(|e7|) < 0.75.

Table 1 shows a brief description of the data used. Our analysis on the PSP observations involved
two particular data sets: one covering the period between November 1 and November 10, 2018,

which was dominated essentially by slow wind flows, and the other one between November 15 and
November 21, 2018 dominated by high speed flows. In both sets, the spurious data (i.e., high artificial
peaks) in the SPC moments were removed using a linear interpolation (see, Bandyopadhyay et al.
2020; Parashar et al. 2020) and the data set was resampled to 0.873 s time resolution. For the

data at 1 AU, we used the same data set analyzed in (Hadid et al. 2017), i-e., the period 2008-2011,
where a large survey of the THEMIS data has been reported. his data set was resampled to 3s time
resolution and we only used the events that fulfilled our criteria, covering both the fast and slow solar
wind. Finally, magnetic field observations from MAVEN spacecraft were analyzed to discriminate
events in the pristine solar wind with and without wave activity (Russell et al. 1990; Mazelle et al.
2004). As discussed in the Introduction, recently, the incompressible energy cascade rate has been
investigated at the Martian environment plasma (Andrés et al. 2020). Here, we used the same data
set for the solar wind observations without presence of proton cyclotron waves (also see, Romanelli
et al. 2013, 2016; Halekas et al. 2020; Romeo et al. 2021).

It is worth mentioning that the local solar wind temperature from the SWIA instrument (onboard
MAVEN) and the ESA instrument (onboard THEMIS) may overestimate the temperature moments
by a factor of ~ 2 due to the trace presence of alpha particles (Halekas et al. 2017). In fact, the local
temperature enters in the compressible exact law only in the compressible term (17) through the
definition of the sound speed in the internal energy, i.e., e = c? log(p/p0), where c, is the isothermal
sound speed. ‘lo investigate the impact of a possible overestimation of the solar wind temperature in
the MAVEN observations, we have computed the compressible cascade component taking into account
half of the measured temperature. While in some cases the compressible component decreases (by
a factor ~ 2), the statistical results, trends and conclusions in this paper are not affected by this
potential temperature overestimation.

Figure 1 shows the occurrence rate for all the analyzed events in the three data sets for the number
density, velocity, and Alfvén velocity field absolute values, respectively. As we expect, while THEMIS
and MAVEN data sets have similar range of mean values for the number density, proton and Alfvén

4. RESULTS
4.1. The compressible cascade rate and the MHD scales

In order to compute the compressible cascade (17), we constructed temporal correlation functions
of the different turbulent fields at different time lags in the interval [4,2100] s. Figure 2 shows the
compressible energy cascade rate absolute values |ec| as a function of the time lag 7 for each mission.
As a reference, in gray color mark what would correspond to the MHD inertial range. As we expect,
our findings show a clear amplification of the compressible cascade as we approach to the Sun, which
can be explained by the increase of the magnetic and velocity field fluctuations closer to the sun (see
Fig. 3). In order to quantify statistically the increment in the cascade rates, we consider the mean
of the absolute value in the largest MHD scales (7 € |{100, 1800] s) as a representative value of each
event.

velocity and magnetic fluctuations increase as we approach to the Sun (e.g., Bruno & Carbone 2005;
Matthaeus & Velli 2011). On the other hand, considering that the plasma compressibility increases
up to 25 % in the PSP perihelion, we observe moderate increases of the total compressible cascades
with respect to the incompressible cascades. ‘This is in agreement with previous work in the solar
wind and the Earth’s magnetosheath (Hadid et al. 2017; Huang & Sahraoui 2019; Andrés et al. 2019).

Figure 4 and 5 show the compressible component (|€9c|) (relate to Eq. (16)) as a function of the

compressible Yaglom-like component €,c coincides with the incompressible component ¢€;, while the
compressible term €9c is negligible. However, when the density fluctuations increase in the plasma
(up to 25%), the dominant component is given by a competition between ¢,¢ and €9c. We recall
that, independently of the level of density fluctuations, we assumed that the source, hybrid and £dependent terms are negligible in the MHD inertial range based on the simulation results of Andrés
et al. (2018), and thus are not estimated here.

4.3. Relation between cascade rate and local temperature

In order to connect the turbulent cascade rate and the local ion temperature, we study the correlation of the compressible cascade rate with the ion temperatures for the slow and fast solar wind
plasma. Figure 6 shows the solar wind ion temperatures as a function of the absolute value of the
total compressible energy cascade rates. The colorbar corresponds to the mean solar wind velocity.
The observational results show a clear trend between the increase in the solar wind temperature and
the compressible cascade rates. As the cascade rate increases, we observe a slight increase in the

5. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

To the best of our knowledge, we reported the first estimation of the compressible energy transfer
rate in the solar wind at ~ 0.2- 0.4 AU and 1.5- 1.7 AU, using PSP and MAVEN observations, respectively. As we get close to the Sun, we observed a slight increase in the density, velocity and magnetic
fluctuations (Bruno & Carbone 2005). For the most compressible events (when compressibility is
~ 25%), in the first PSP perihelion (on November 6, 2018), we observe that the compressible energy
cascade rate is at least 5 order of magnitude larger than the cascade at ~ 1.6 AU. Also, we observe a
erowth in the compressible cascade rate with respect to the incompressible rate. ‘he increase in the
compressible (and incompressible) cascade rates when we compare the results between 0.2 AU and
1.7 AU is mainly due to the increase in the magnetic and the number density fluctuation levels (see
Figures 1 and 3). Previous studies showed that the density fluctuations would increase considerably
the cascade rate when compressibility is larger than 30% or when it enters to the sub-ion scales (see,
Hadid et al. 2017; Andrés et al. 2018; Andrés et al. 2019). Our results are compatible with these
findings at the MHD scales. Also, Adhikari et al. (2020) have computed the frequency distributions
of the solar wind compressibility between 0.17 AU and 0.61 AU using PSP observations. ‘Their results show that density fluctuations (normalized to the mean density) is concentrated mainly around
0.15, which is compatible with the density fluctuation levels found in this study. In contrast, recent
computations of the magnetic compressibility coefficient Cg = (6|B|/|6B])° at 0.17 AU have shown
a clear decreases toward smaller heliocentric distances (at all frequencies) (see, Chen et al. 2020). In
particular, the authors have observed that magnetic compressibility levels at the PSP perihelion are
an order of magnitude smaller than at 1 AU. However, this decrease in the magnetic compressibility

shows no overall impact in the density fluctuation level and consequently in the compressible cascade
rate estimations.

Our findings here for different heliocentric distances confirm that density fluctuations in the solar
wind amplifies the cascade rate with respect to the incompressible model (Sorriso-Valvo et al. 2007;
Andrés et al. 2020; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2020). When density fluctuations are relatively larger than
~ 15%, our results show that the leading role in the amplification of the cascade rate is due to a
competition between the new compressible flux component (|€2c|) and the compressible Yaglom-like
generalization (|€1c|) in the exact relation. As the plasma compressibility locally increases through
the heliosphere we observe two clear features: on one hand, the Yaglom-like component |¢1c| becomes
more spread (larger and/or smaller values) around the incompressible value. While this feature could
be due to the relatively poor statistics in the THEMIS and MAVEN analyzed data sets, the spread
could be due to the large plasma density fluctuation levels present in the PSP data set. On the
other hand, as the plasma compressibility increases we observe that the compressible component €2c¢
becomes of the order of the Yaglom-like component in the inertial range. Andrés et al. (2018) have
computed all the terms in Eq. (5) using DNS for sub-sonic isothermal compressible MHD turbulence.
The authors found that even for large guide field values, the energy cascade rate €c is mainly due
to the flux terms. Also, they observed that €9cq increases at least one order of magnitude when
plasma compressibility is increased by a factor two in the system. Furthermore, they found that
when compressibility increases in the plasma, the compressible component becomes dominant in the
transfer of the energy. ‘These numerical finding are in agreement with our observational results in
Figures 4 and 5. We speculate that this trend should be observed in more compressible plasma
environments, like the Earth’s magnetosheath (Huang et al. 2017; Hadid et al. 2017; Andrés et al.
2019; Li et al. 2020).

Our observational results show a correlation between the solar wind temperature and the compressible energy cascade rate. The larger is the cascade rate, the higher is the temperature. Also, a
clear increase in the temperature is connected with fast solar wind speeds. ‘The relation between the
cascade rate and the local temperature in the solar wind has been studied previously in the literature
(see, Vasquez et al. 2007; MacBride et al. 2008; Marino et al. 2008; Banerjee et al. 2016). As we
discussed above, the turbulent cascade rate has been proposed as a solution to the solar wind heating
problem (e.g., Richardson et al. 1995; Matthaeus & Velli 2011). Our observational results here support the idea that the compressible turbulent cascade may heat the plasma at different heliocentric

distances. Finally, we emphasize that all results reported here were obtained inside the solar wind
ecliptic plane. A natural extension of this study would be the use of the ESA recently launched Solar
Orbiter mission (Miiller et al. 2020) data. Its observations should give us access to the polar regions

of the solar wind within heliocentric distance never explored before.
