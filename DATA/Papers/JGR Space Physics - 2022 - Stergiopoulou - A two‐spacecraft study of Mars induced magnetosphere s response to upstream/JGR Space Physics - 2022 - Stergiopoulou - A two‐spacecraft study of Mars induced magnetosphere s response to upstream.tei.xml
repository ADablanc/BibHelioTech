<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This is a two-spacecraft study, in which we investigate the effects of the upstream solar wind conditions on the Martian induced magnetosphere and upper ionosphere. We use Mars Express (MEX) magnetic field magnitude data together with interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), solar wind density, and velocity measurements from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, from November 2014 to November 2018. We compare simultaneous observations of the magnetic field magnitude in the induced magnetosphere of Mars (|B| IM ) with the IMF magnitude (|B| IMF ), and we examine variations in the ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF with solar wind dynamic pressure, speed and density. We find that the |B| IM /|B| IMF ratio in the induced magnetosphere generally decreases with increased dynamic pressure and that a more structured interaction is seen when comparing induced fields to the instantaneous IMF, where reductions in the relative fields at the magnetic pile up boundary (MPB) are more evident than in the field strength itself, along with enhancements in the immediate vicinity of the optical shadow of Mars. We interpret these results as evidence that while the induced magnetosphere is indeed compressed and induced field strengths are higher during periods of high dynamic pressure, a relatively larger amount of magnetic flux threads the region compared to that available from the unperturbed IMF during low dynamic pressure intervals.</p></div>

Instead its conducting ionosphere acts as an effective obstacle to the incoming solar wind and an induced magnetosphere is formed, the structure of which is determined for instance by the solar wind input, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the Martian crustal magnetic fields and the underlying neutral atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Nagy et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bertucci et al., 2011)</ref>. Many aspects of the Mars-solar wind interaction are outwardly comparable to those at Venus, as was extensively studied during the Pioneer-Venus era, and thus much of the understanding developed initially for Venus can be transferred to the Mars interaction, despite differences of scale, solar wind conditions etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Luhmann &amp; Cravens, 1991)</ref>. Moreover, the Mars-solar wind interaction has been extensively studied in recent years by ESA's Mars Express (MEX) and NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evo-lutioN (MAVEN) missions, and relevant aspects are summarized below.</p><p>The Mars-solar wind interaction is typically characterized by the formation of several distinct plasma boundaries separating regions of differing plasma properties and compositions. At the largest distances, the bow shock is formed upstream from the planet, inside which the solar wind is slowed, heated and deflected around the ionospheric obstacle in the magnetosheath (i.e <ref type="bibr">Vignes et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mazelle et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hall et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The magnetic pile-up boundary (MPB, and sometimes alternately referred to as the induced magnetospheric boundary, IMB) is that surface that separates the heated solar wind plasma of the magnetosheath from the upper layers of the Martian ionosphere. Importantly, however, no strong consensus yet exists regarding the physical parameters that specifically delineate the MPB. It has variously been defined as a pressure-balance surface <ref type="bibr">(Holmberg et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Girazian et al., 2019)</ref>, or by gradients in plasma and field pressures <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2021)</ref>, and is also at least often well correlated with changes in the plasma composition from solar wind (H + ) to planetary ions (O + , O + 2 ) dominated regimes (hence the occasionally used name, ion composition boundary, ICB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Halekas et al., 2018)</ref>. Comparing these different definitions, it should be noted that the differences in location and behavior remain generally small compared to the intrinsic variability of the location of the MPB with upstream conditions. In this paper we adopt a definition of the MPB as the lower edge of the magnetosheath as being sufficient for the essentially illustrative purposes required here. Similarly, the magnetic pile up region (MPR) can be taken to be defined as the region below the MPB. A sharp gradient in plasma den-as the solar wind is decelerated and heated, the thermal pressure becomes significant compared to the dynamic pressure, while in the MPR the dominant term is the magnetic pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Crider et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dubinin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holmberg et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Crider et al. (2003)</ref>, using the magnetic pressure in the MPR as a proxy for P dyn , have shown that for high P dyn the MPB moves closer to the planet. The dependence of the MPB location on P dyn was additionally confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brain et al. (2005)</ref>. The downward shifting of the bow shock and MPB locations during periods of high P dyn was once more demonstrated in a statistical study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Edberg et al. (2009)</ref>. The ionopause's location is also dependent on P dyn , as when it is found (45% rate of occurrence in MAVEN electron density profiles) it is located at the altitude where the total ionospheric pressure approximately balances the solar wind dynamic pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(SÃ¡nchez-Cano et al., 2020)</ref>. Holmberg et al. <ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref>, following the earlier study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dubinin et al. (2008)</ref> computed the individual contributions (dynamic, thermal and magnetic) to the pressure in the plasma near the sub-solar point, showing clearly that a balance between the upstream dynamic pressure and the magnetic pressure in the induced magnetosphere is generally satisfied, though it may often not be appropriate to describe this region wholly by the complete separation of plasma regimes across well-defined boundaries.</p><p>Taking advantage of the long durations over which MEX and MAVEN have been orbiting Mars, the aim of this work is to further assess the response of the Martian in--4-</p></div>

This affords a comparison of the extent to which the induced magnetosphere is altered in its structure in response to variations in the solar wind, and provides a measure by which the draping of the IMF in the induced magnetosphere can be compared to the unperturbed solar wind. In section 2 we present solar wind statistical correlations and results of the magnetospheric response to various upstream conditions, in section 3 we discuss our findings and in section 4 we summarize our main conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Observations</head><p>We use simultaneous measurements from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsur- When operated in the Active Ionospheric Sounding (AIS) mode, MARSIS measures the propagation time delay of radar pulses with frequencies â¼0.1-5.5 MHz from the spacecraft to the Martian ionosphere, where they are reflected as they enter the dense planetary plasma <ref type="bibr">(Picardi et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jordan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gurnett et al., 2005)</ref>. The pulse sequence is repeated every 7.5 seconds while the instrument is active. Typically MAR-SIS is operated at altitudes below â¼1500 km, although it is not activated in AIS mode during each periapsis pass. In AIS mode, MARSIS is also able to measure the local electron density, through the oscillations excited near the spacecraft at the local plasma frequency and its higher harmonics <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gurnett et al., 2005)</ref>, albeit only during intervals when MEX is not located in fast flowing plasma regions and for electron densities n e &gt;â¼ 10 cm â3 -5-</p></div>

Furthermore, the local magnetic field magnitude at the spacecraft altitude can often be calculated from signals at the cyclotron frequency of accelerated electrons near the antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gurnett et al., 2005)</ref>. We emphasize that this measurement does not provide any information regarding the magnetic field vector. In this paper, only in-situ measurements from MARSIS in AIS mode are analyzed, using the highest possible measurement cadence of 7.5 seconds and processed as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Andrews et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Andrews et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>To obtain a clearer understanding of the processes controlling the structure of the Martian induced magnetosphere, upstream solar wind parameters need to be taken into account for a real time comparison. The necessary solar wind input is provided by SWIA and MAG onboard MAVEN <ref type="bibr">(Halekas, Ruhunusiri, et al., 2017)</ref>. SWIA measures ion density, temperature and velocity in the solar wind and magnetosheath within an energy range of 5 eV to 25 keV and a time resolution of 4 seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Halekas et al., 2015)</ref>, while the two fluxgate magnetometer sensors measure the vector magnetic field with a sample rate of 32 samples per second <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Connerney et al., 2015)</ref>. Preceding the aerobraking operations phase in early 2019, MAVEN's elliptical orbit permitted it to routinely sample the solar wind directly, although not continuously. Processing of these data on ground to improve the quality of the derived quantities further reduces their cadence to â¼46 seconds, averaging over the effects of upstream fluctuations with shorter timescales <ref type="bibr">(Halekas, Ruhunusiri, et al., 2017)</ref>. Intervals where the instrument did not directly sample the undisturbed ("pristine") solar wind are excluded <ref type="bibr">(Halekas, Ruhunusiri, et al., 2017)</ref>. These measurements of solar wind density, velocity, and the IMF can be taken to provide concurrent upstream driving conditions to compare to measurements from MEX, and their effects on the induced magnetosphere and ionosphere can be studied. We note that while MAVEN only encounters the pristine solar wind on â¼60% of all orbits <ref type="bibr">(Halekas, Ruhunusiri, et al., 2017)</ref>, the fraction of time for which MARSIS is operated in AIS mode on MEX is much smaller, less than 10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gurnett et al., 2005)</ref>. Thus, intervals of simultaneous measurements remain relatively rare.</p><p>To demonstrate what we consider as simultaneous observations between the two spacecraft throughout this paper, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, we show as an example data from MEX orbit 14767 and MAVEN orbit 1754 obtained during Day Of Year (DOY) 235 and 236 in 2015. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a and b</ref>, the energy spectrum and the density and speed of the pristine solar wind <ref type="bibr">(Halekas, Ruhunusiri, et al., 2017)</ref> from SWIA on MAVEN are presented.</p></div>

(2003)</ref>, are shown.</p><p>It can be seen that, close to periapsis at â¼23:37, the measured magnetic field agrees closely with that predicted by the <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cain et al. (2003)</ref> model, but deviates from it at higher altitudes where the relative contribution of the draped IMF becomes larger. For completeness, we also show those erroneous measurements of magnetic field strength that can clearly be seen to deviate from the general trends, both to higher and lower values, which we attribute to additional noise in the ionograms from which these values are ultimately derived. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d and e</ref> the MEX and MAVEN trajectories in MSO coordinates are depicted as red and blue lines respectively in Mars radii units (1 R M = 3389.5 km) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ï MSO = Y 2 MSO + Z 2 MSO .</formula><p>The black segment on the red MEX orbit trace denotes the time during which MARSIS was operating in AIS mode, while the black boxes on the blue orbit show where MAVEN was located during the same interval. The dotted and dashed lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> represent the bow shock and MPB locations based on the model by <ref type="bibr">Vignes et al. (2000)</ref>. Comparing the trajectory plot of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> with Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a and   b</ref>, we notice that MAVEN happens to be located in the solar wind only for a few minutes during the MARSIS ionospheric passing.</p><p>The simultaneous data used in this study from these specific orbits are contained in the grey shaded region shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b and c</ref>. For each |B| IM data point by MAR-SIS we look for the temporally closest solar wind observation by MAVEN within 300 seconds; when this condition is fulfilled we then consider this pair of observations as simultaneous, as illustrated with the grey shaded area in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b and c</ref>. If possible, i.e. when solar wind measurements are available both before and after a MARSIS measurement, linear interpolation is also performed. Longer intervals of unavailable data, due e.g. to MAVEN leaving the undisturbed solar wind, MARSIS deactivating or switching out of AIS mode, or any other reason, are not further analyzed. Thus, when this approach is applied to the interval shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, only MARSIS data obtained within the grey shaded interval are further considered in this study, and all other data are rejected for further analysis. The 300 second upper limit applied as part of the selection of data is in part chosen to overcome atypical MARSIS operations schemes where the instrument is repeatedly switched between sub-surface and ionospheric sounding. It should be noted that this does not mean that the data are averaged in any way over this timescale; in-stead, the median elapsed time between individual MARSIS and SWIA measurements compared in this study is found to be â¼16 seconds, and the time interval between simultaneous pairs of data points does not exceed 300 seconds. We note that this approach differs somewhat from that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Girazian et al. (2019)</ref> in analyzing data from both MAVEN and MEX, where average solar wind parameters were computed for an hourlong interval prior to the AIS data acquisition on each MEX orbit, and therefore variations in upstream conditions during the interval over which AIS data are acquired are not factored into their analysis. Furthermore, we note that a related analysis has been presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Halekas, Brain, et al. (2017)</ref>, in which the X-component of the magnetic field in the induced magnetosphere was compared to the upstream value, determined using single-spacecraft measurements.</p><p>To briefly illustrate the typical range and interdependencies of the upstream conditions, we summarize the solar wind and IMF measurements from MAVEN in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. Specifically, we show the correlations between the solar wind dynamic pressure (P dyn , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>), speed (|v| sw , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>) and density (n sw , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>) with IMF (|B| IMF ), as well as the anti-correlation between solar wind density and speed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Ï, for the corresponding quantities has also been calculated and it is shown in each panel. In each case, only data taken in the pristine solar wind are shown, and the solar wind dynamic pressure is P dyn = Ï sw v 2 sw , where Ï sw is the solar wind mass density and v sw the solar wind velocity. Data are shown only for the interval from November 2014 to November 2018 during periods where MEX AIS measurements of the magnetic field magnitude were simultaneously available, as used in this study and demonstrated in the example orbits in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. The color-code in the four subplots represents the number of data points (N) per bin. The quantities depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> (P dyn , |v| sw , n sw , |B| IMF ) vary within their typical ranges. We observe a general trend of higher dynamic pressure corresponding to greater IMF magnitude values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>), which is also seen in solar wind density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>), whereas in the speed-IMF relationship (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>) no such trend is observed. Furthermore, the solar wind density and speed exhibit a degree of anti-correlation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>). </p></div>

As in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2 and 3</ref>, Spearman's correlation coefficient, Ï, is shown in each panel. The corresponding confidence widths <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fisher, 1921;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bonett &amp; Wright, 2000)</ref> for each pair of variables plotted in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2, 3</ref> and 4 were also computed (not shown in the figures). In the majority of the cases, the confidence width of Ï is no greater than 0.02, while for a few pairs of variables it reaches 0.03, meaning that random samples of the same data would return a correlation coefficient within this range 95% of the time. Here, only data obtained on the dayside are included, where control by the motional electric field is anticipated to be most effective owing to the greater penetration of this field into the induced magnetosphere. The term dayside, in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3 and 4</ref>, corresponds to observations that come from regions with solar zenith angle no greater than 90 degrees (SZA &lt; 90 â¢ ). In general, the correlation between the ratio and the Mach number (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a, c</ref>) as well as the ratio and the dynamic pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4b, d</ref>) follow the same trends already observed in the MSO frame previously in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>. Comparing the results obtained in the two opposing electric field hemispheres (+E, âE) within each column of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>, the spread and the resulting correlations within the measurements do not seem to differ importantly, indicating the solar wind electric field not being a crucial aspect when investigating the magnetic field magnitude enhancement in the induced magnetosphere as a function of Mach number and the dynamic pressure. Any minor differences that may be noted between the results obtained in the opposing hemispheres and departures from the trends observed earlier in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> are likely due to the further separation of the data into sub-sets.</p><p>In order to introduce the general structure of the magnetic field magnitude of the upper ionosphere, the same data are now analysed in the altitude -SZA coordinate system appropriate to studying spatial variations in the induced magnetosphere.

There is some suggestion that immediately following the transition into shadow, in some bins the field strength is observed to increase, possibly indicative of a more complex interaction between the draped fields and the ionosphere. This may either be attributed to more localized fields associated with the tail current sheet, or could also be the result of the apparent twist in the magnetotail configuration caused by magnetic reconnection between the IMF and crustal fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(DiBraccio et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>An additional contribution, present only at low altitudes in the nightside, stems from the crustal fields which, depending on the specific planetocentric location of the underlying observations, may be the dominant contribution to the measured fields. These crustal fields necessarily decrease in strength rapidly with altitude, much faster than the draped fields on the dayside. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Andrews et al. (2015)</ref>, the local magnetic field magnitude can only be reliably determined by AIS if it lies in the range â¼5-200 nT, owing to the (range) resolution of the sounder. Further issues of sensitivity may also be expected in regions of particularly low plasma density. We note also that the ionospheric mode of MARSIS is favoured mostly for dayside operations, whereas on the nightside it is often switched off to facilitate subsurface observations for altitudes lower than â¼800 km <ref type="bibr">(Picardi et al., 2004)</ref>. Cumulatively, given that the quantities plotted in Figures 5a and 5b are mean values, these effects necessarily lead to the larger relative contribution of the more intense crustal field sources at low altitudes on the nightside, as compared to the much weaker or indeed generally absent draped IMF, or fields associated with the induced magnetotail at the same location. As discussed previously, it is not possible to separate draped or induced magnetic fields from crustal sources, given the scalar nature of the measurements by MARSIS.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5b</ref> we directly compare the induced fields to the instantaneous fields of the upstream IMF, plotting the ratio of the magnetic field magnitude from MEX over the IMF measured simultaneously (|B| IM /|B| IMF ), corresponding to the data shown first in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>.

There does also appear to be some evidence of locally enhanced ratios scattered at and slightly anti-sunward of the optical shadow boundary itself, although this is only confined to a few bins and may simply be due to random variation in the underlying data. While some suggestion of this enhancement was detected in a few individual bins at the same locations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>, the effect is much clearer in the ratios shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5b</ref>. The same enhancement in the ratio at the lowest altitudes shown on the nightside is again present, owing to the contribution of crustal magnetic field sources to the measurements in the absence of significant draped IMF fields in this region.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5c</ref>, for reference, the corresponding coverage of the simultaneous MEX and MAVEN observations is shown in the time interval between November 2014 and November 2018. A strong bias towards the dayside and a relatively undersampled upper nightside due to the additional condition of available contemporaneous solar wind MAVEN data is observed, indicating the relative strength of the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the trends seen in different regions of the induced magnetosphere.</p><p>Having established the overall magnetic field structure of the upper ionosphere, we proceed to investigate how it varies with upstream solar wind conditions. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>, we re-analyze the same data already presented, by dividing it into three groups defined by the upper, lower and inter-quartile ranges of three solar wind parameters, namely the solar wind dynamic pressure (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6a-f</ref>), speed (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6g-i</ref>) and density (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6j-l</ref>). While further sub-divisions of the data were also examined, the limitations of coverage both in altitude and SZA, and indeed season, latitude and local time generally preclude drawing conclusions due to biases introduced. |B| IM and |B| IM /|B| IMF for low (P dyn &lt; 0.5 nPa), intermediate (0.5 nPa &lt; P dyn &lt; 1.1 nPa) and high solar wind dynamic pressure (P dyn &gt; 1.1 nPa) are presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6a and d</ref>, 6b and e, and 6c and f respectively, with the format otherwise derived from that used in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>. More intense induced fields are observed in the dayside during periods of high solar wind dynamic pressure, as shown in the three upper plots (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6a-c</ref>), consistent with the pressure balance expected between the induced magnetosphere and the upstream solar wind, illustrating the ability of the induced magnetosphere to adjust to varying solar wind conditions. Comparing the induced fields relative to the IMF however, a different picture emerges, as is evident in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6d-f</ref>. The induced fields are readily seen to be relatively more while the IMF itself is (typically) increased in magnitude during intervals of higher solar wind dynamic pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>), the induced fields in the dayside ionosphere are observed to be stronger relative to the IMF during intervals of lower dynamic pressure.</p><p>(We emphasize that this is consistent with the results already discussed for the same data analyzed as a whole and presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3 and 4</ref>.)</p><p>In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6g-l</ref> 3.9 cm â3 ) and high (n sw &gt; 3.9 cm â3 ) solar wind density, in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6j, k and l</ref>, respectively. While there are no significant differences in the structure of the ratios between the cases of slow and fast solar wind (Figures 6g and i respectively), the solar wind density seems to influence the relative induced fields in a similar fashion to dynamic pressure, that is to say producing an enhanced ratio for low solar wind density in the dayside and the MPB region. This is also supported by the power-law relationship between both the solar wind dynamic pressure and density, and the IMF we see in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a and   c</ref>.</p></div>

To ensure that the solar wind electric field does not play a key role, as the dynamic pressure does, in determining the ratio of the field strengths at a given location, we plot again |B| IM /|B| IMF in SZA -altitude diagrams for low, intermediate and high P dyn , but this time we divide the dataset into the positive and negative electric field hemispheres as depicted in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7a-c</ref> and 7d-f respectively. In the lower pressure regime, a higher ratio is seen in the upper ionosphere in the -E hemisphere, while for intermediate SZAs (80 â¢ â120 â¢ ) the ratio is greater in the +E hemisphere (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7a, d</ref>). The ratio seems to be more enhanced in the dayside in the +E hemisphere for high solar wind dynamic pressure (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7c, f</ref>), however for intermediate values of dynamic pressure, besides moderate local enhancements near the MPB in the upper ionosphere in the -E hemisphere, the distribution of the ratio values around Mars is rather similar in the two plots <ref type="bibr">(Figures 7b,</ref><ref type="bibr">e)</ref>. Despite these differences in the ratio between +E and -E, the overall tendency of |B| IM /|B| IMF being noticeably more enhanced for low dynamic pressures can be clearly observed in both electric field hemispheres in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref>.</p><p>In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1 and 2</ref>, we show the mean and the standard error of the mean (meanÂ±SEM) of the strength of the magnetic field in the induced magnetosphere (|B| IM ) and the relative ratio over the IMF (|B| IM /|B| IMF ) respectively, first for the whole dataset subdivided into different regions based on the optical shadow, latitude (northern or southern hemisphere) and the solar wind electric field, and then for the subsets of low, intermediate and high P dyn as they result from the quartile partitions and have used in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6 and 7</ref>, again subdivided into the same regions as before.

What is more, we see generally higher values of |B| IM in the +E hemisphere, both on the dayside irrespective of latitude and when we restrict northern latitudes only (where any direct influence of crustal field sources is minimized). The same behavior among the different regions is observed too, for the low, intermediate and high P dyn regimes, although comparatively, for low P dyn the magnetic field magnitude appears to diverge much less.

Simultaneous data, chosen as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, of magnetic field magnitude from MEX and IMF from MAVEN allows us a real time comparison of the magnetospheric response to solar wind parameters. The statistical distribution of the solar wind measured by MAVEN during the interval examined, constrained also to the periods immediately surrounding MARSIS operations in AIS mode, was shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. Utilizing measurements of the local magnetic field magnitude made by MARSIS, we have examined the induced magnetosphere's structure and variation with upstream conditions, both in terms of the absolute induced fields and relative to the upstream IMF.</p><p>To highlight how variations in the strength of the magnetic field in the induced magnetosphere correspond to variations in the volume of the solar wind region it is linked to, we illustrate, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref>, the Mars-Solar wind interaction in which field lines of the IMF (blue lines) are incident on the system and pile up at and above the dayside ionosphere.

The pile-up of the IMF field lines occurs as their motion past and through the ionospheric obstacle is slowed, and as a consequence, the field strength in the induced magnetosphere is significantly enhanced relative to the unperturbed solar wind. Field lines that can be considered to be part of the induced magnetosphere, crossing the MPB and therefore having at least some extent within the MPR, are shown as red lines. We note that an additional, smaller enhancement to the field strength also occurs in the immediately post-shocked IMF, where the slowing (and heating and diversion) leads to compression of the field lines with a limiting theoretical relative enhancement of a factor 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Russell et al., 2016)</ref>. The linear extent of the induced magnetosphere on the Sun-Mars line, X IM , is indicated in the fig-</p><p>ure by the horizontal black bar. This is taken to be the altitude of the MPB at the subsolar point, and those IMF field lines that pass through this region are shown red. The horizontal extent of the region threaded by these same field lines in the otherwise undisturbed solar wind, X Tail , is indicated by the longer black bar, across which all the redcolored IMF field lines pass. Following the definitions adopted in this paper for the MPB and MPR, we correspondingly define X IM to be the altitude of the MPB at the sub-solar point. It should be noted however, that the nature of the MPB, which in some sense is more akin to a transition between plasma regimes and is not therefore vanishingly thin compared to the magnetosheath and MPR above and below it, makes these definitions somewhat arbitrary. As depicted, the regions X IM and X Tail are therefore magnetically linked and to first-order, consideration of conservation of magnetic flux gives a simple relationship between the ratio of the field strength of the induced magnetosphere, |B| IM , and the unperturbed upstream field |B| IMF that can be compared to the ratio of these two length scales,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">|B| IM |B| IMF = X Tail X IM .

Hence, the increase in the magnetic field strength in the induced magnetosphere, |B| IM , measured by MEX, can be compared to the strength of the unperturbed IMF |B| IMF , measured by MAVEN. The ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF provides a simple indication of the relative compression or expansion of the induced magnetosphere, being related to the length scale over which IMF field lines are perturbed in their passage around and through the Martian ionospheric obstacle (with higher ratios indicative of a relatively expanded system, and vice-versa). In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3 and 4</ref>, we first examined the correspondence between the ratio of these two measured field strengths, and upstream values of the solar wind dynamic pressure and Alfvn Mach number (proportional to the ratio of the dynamic pressure to the IMF strength squared). This comparison, initially made irrespective of MEX's position within the induced magnetosphere, showed the expected dependence, with the relative magnetic fields rising with increasing Alfvn</p><p>Mach number, and falling with increasing dynamic pressure. We then sub-divide these data into both observations made only in the northern hemisphere and on the dayside, where any potential influence of crustal fields is minimized, and also into the +E and -E hemispheres in the MSE coordinate system, again restricting them to the dayside only.</p><p>In both cases, no significant departures from the general trends are evident, strongly suggesting that both the crustal fields and the local orientation of the motional electric field play only minor roles, on average, in establishing the induced magnetosphere and modulating its response to variations in the upstream conditions. The mass loading of the solar wind by escaping planetary ions is known to be asymmetric (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dong et al., 2015)</ref> as fluxes are significantly higher in the +E hemisphere, and a related effect has been noted in the form of the induced magnetic fields (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dubinin et al., 2019)</ref>.

The response of the induced magnetosphere to intervals of relatively enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure leads to the enhancement of the induced fields, in absolute magnitude, most clearly on the dayside as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6a</ref>, b and c.</p><p>However, when the induced field is instead again analyzed relative to the instantaneous value of the IMF by calculating the ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF , a rather different picture emerges, particularly when examining the response of this quantity to factors such as the solar wind dynamic pressure, speed and density. As noted, while the magnetic field magnitude in the induced magnetosphere measured by MEX increases during the high P dyn periods (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6c</ref>), when we compute the ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF we find instead reduced relative induced fields for high solar wind dynamic pressure, mainly on the dayside and up to the nominal MPB region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6f</ref>). Moreover, while the averaged values of the induced fields observed by MEX on the dayside do not appreciably vary in any way at or near the nominal MPB location, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>, the ratio of the induced to IMF field, |B| IM /|B| IMF , does appear to show more organization by this boundary, with typically higher values found immediately below the boundary than above. This could perhaps be taken as a signature of currents flowing near or below the boundary, acting to enhance the induced fields below and reducing them above, thus bearing at least some outward similarity to the magnetopause at the Earth, as shown recently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ramstad et al. (2020)</ref>. We note that the analysis presented here only completely covers the region of SZAs from 40 to 160 degrees at the periapsis altitude of MEX, and hence these conclusions are only supported by observations in this region. However, based on related studies of the structure of the magnetic fields closer towards the sub-solar point, which find field strengths that vary only weakly on average with SZA below 45 Turning to the tail, the induced (draped) field strength tentatively rises in strength immediately following the transition into shadow, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>, likely indicative of the more dynamic aspects of the Martian induced magnetotail as reported elsewhere, and suggesting that the fields observed in the tail are not purely those of the draped IMF.</p><p>However, systematic effects here arising from the somewhat indirect measurement of the local field strength by MARSIS may distort this picture and cannot immediately be ruled out, given the rather different bulk plasma conditions at these altitudes on the nightside as compared to the dayside.

Separating the solar wind dynamic pressure into its components, we notice that there is little evidence for systematic variation in the values of this ratio with increasing solar wind speed seen by comparing Figures 6g, h to move closer to the planet during intervals of high dynamic pressure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Edberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Halekas, Brain, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hall et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ramstad, Barabash, Futaana, &amp; HolmstrÃ¶m, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hall et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matsunaga et al., 2017)</ref>, the amplitude of this motion is only a small fraction of a Mars radius at the sub-solar point. Assuming that the MPB altitude at the subsolar point corresponds to X IM and taking it to be a constant, X IM = 0.3R M , calculated using the <ref type="bibr">Vignes et al. (2000)</ref> model, X Tail then ranges between â¼8000 km (â¼ 2.4R M ) and â¼13000 km (â¼ 3.7R M ), for high and low P dyn respectively (using the mean ratio shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> for the whole dayside). Thus, while the induced magnetosphere and associated plasma boundaries are compressed during intervals of higher upstream pressure, the spatial extent in the solar wind of IMF flux-tubes that thread and form the induced magnetosphere is in fact larger during intervals of lower dynamic pressure. We note that while the relationship expressed above and in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">2</ref>) was obtained by considering only conservation of flux along the Mars-Sun line, the relatively weak dependence of B IM on solar zenith angle permits the extrapolation of the calculation to a large fraction of the dayside region. This observation may provide some indication of the mechanisms at work that lead to the observed enhancement in the efficiency of transfer of energy from the solar wind to the escaping ionospheric plasma ob-in its passage through and around the Martian system. By further dividing X Tail with the corresponding mean solar wind speed (|v| sw ) for each case, we get also a rough estimate for the timescale solar wind needs to cover the X Tail distance and that ranges from â¼18 to â¼32 seconds for high and low P dyn respectively. We note that such short values, statistically determined though they are, indeed are close to the fidelity of our available data, defined by the median spacing between SWIA and MARSIS measurements of â¼16 seconds. Moreover, the estimates of this timescale are consistent within a factor of â¼2 to those obtained by <ref type="bibr">Harada et al. (2017)</ref> in tracking a pressure pulse from the solar wind through the induced magnetosphere. We reiterate, however, that such arguments based on these field strength ratios and the conservation of magnetic flux should not be overinterpreted, as they are strictly only applicable in limited circumstances, specifically where the X-component of the IMF is small.</p><p>Many details of the electrodynamics of the Martian induced magnetosphere remain poorly understood. The 'canonical' picture is one in which enhanced upstream dynamic pressures in particular are responsible for enhanced induced fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Crider et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Girazian et al., 2019)</ref>, increased atmospheric escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lundin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Nilsson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Girazian et al., 2019)</ref>, and more activity in the tail <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Girazian et al., 2019)</ref>. However, taken together, our results suggest that some caution should be taken in describing such dependencies, since the induced fields themselves are conversely more significantly enhanced relative to the IMF during intervals of lower dynamic pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>Using magnetic field magnitude measurements from MEX in the induced magnetosphere of Mars and upstream solar wind parameters from MAVEN, we have found that, 1. Even though high solar wind dynamic pressure results in stronger induced magnetic fields in the dayside ionosphere, the ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF decreases with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure.</p><p>2. Comparing the induced fields to the instantaneous IMF, we reveal more of the structure in the vicinity of the MPB, where the reductions in the relative fields above MPB are more evident than in the field strength itself.</p><p>-31-</p></div>

Higher values of the mean |B| IM are observed in the +E hemisphere, both on the dayside irrespective of latitude and when we restrict northern latitudes only.</p><p>4. There is a â¼41 % increase of the mean |B| IM , between low and high P dyn in the dayside.</p><p>5. There is a â¼36 % decrease of the mean ratio |B| IM /|B| IMF , from low to high P dyn in the dayside.</p><p>6. The spatial extent in the solar wind of IMF flux-tubes that thread and form the induced magnetosphere is larger during intervals of lower dynamic pressure and we estimate that X Tail ranges from â¼8000 km (â¼ 2.4R M ) to â¼13000 km (â¼ 3.7R M ),</p><p>for high and low P dyn respectively.</p><p>Further investigation is needed for a comprehensive description of the induced magnetosphere's response to various parameters, in particular through studying the system's response to immediate upstream conditions in a more complete approach than can be achieved using only field magnitudes estimated by MARSIS. Other external drivers, such as seasonal and solar-cycle driven variations in ionospheric density due to changing ionizing flux were briefly investigated in this analysis but reliable conclusions could not be drawn given the need to first account for the larger observed dependencies on upstream conditions in the solar wind. Future studies utilizing solar wind data from other sources are necessary to fully explore all controlling factors, and further investigate spatial variations that may be associated for example with the location of Mars' strongest regions of crustal magnetic fields and diurnal asymmetries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>face and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on board MEX, and from the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) instrument and magnetometer (MAG) on board MAVEN during the period between November 2014 and November 2018, to observe the response of the induced magnetosphere of Mars to upstream solar wind conditions. The â¼4 year interval, from which the data used in this study comes from, is dictated primarily by the availability of extended measurements in the pristine solar wind by MAVEN. Due to the aerobraking phase that commenced in early 2019 and the subsequent reduction in apoapsis altitude, MAVEN now spends a smaller percentage of the time in the undisturbed solar wind.</figDesc></figure>
