[1] On 18 March 2011, MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
(MESSENGER) became the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, providing a new opportunity to
study the outer boundary of the planet’s magnetosphere—the magnetopause. Here we
characterize Mercury’s magnetopause using measurements collected by MESSENGER’s
Magnetometer and Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer. Analysis of measurements from two
of MESSENGER’s “hot seasons,” when the orbital periapsis is on Mercury’s dayside and
the magnetopause crossing takes place in the subsolar region, resulted in 43 events with
well-determined boundary normals. The typical duration of a magnetopause traversal

was ~5 s. The average normal magnetic field component was ~20 nT, and the dimensionless
reconnection rate, 1.e., the ratio of the normal magnetic field component to the total field
magnitude just inside the magnetopause, was 0.15 + 0.02. This rate is a factor of ~3 larger
than values found during the most extensive surveys at Earth. The ratio of the reconnection
rate at Mercury to that of the Earth 1s comparable to the ratio of the solar wind Alfvén speeds
at their respective orbits. We also find that the magnetopause reconnection rate at Mercury is
independent of magnetic field shear angle, but it varies inversely with plasma f, the ratio of
total thermal pressure to magnetic pressure, in the magnetosheath. These results suggest that
reconnection at Mercury is not only more intense than at Earth but also that it occurs for nearly
all orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field due to the low-f nature of the solar wind in

the inner heliosphere.

the first spacecraft to orbit the planet Mercury, which
possesses an intrinsic magnetic field discovered by Mariner
10 [Ness et al., 1974, 1975]. MESSENGER data from three
Mercury flybys and the first Mercury year in orbit (1 Mercury
year = 88 Earth days) confirmed this discovery and refined the
strength and orientation of the magnetic dipole. We now know
that Mercury’s magnetic moment is 195 + 10 nT-R?, (where
Rw 18 Mercury’s radius, or 2440 km) [Anderson et al., 2008,
2010; Alexeev et al., 2010]. Furthermore, the MESSENGER
magnetic field data show a clear northward offset of the dipole
moment from the center of the planet by 484 + 11 km
[Anderson et al., 2011], approximately 20% of the planet’s
radius. The interaction between the solar wind and the
planetary magnetic field creates a highly dynamic magnetosphere exhibiting many of the processes observed at Earth,
including magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection
[Slavin et al., 2008, 2009], ultralow-frequency and KelvinHelmholtz waves [Boardsen et al., 2009, 2010; Sundberg
et al., 2010], and substorm-type magnetotail loading and
unloading, near-tail dipolarization, and plasmoid ejection
[Slavin et al., 2010, 2012; Sundberg et al., 2012], but on
much shorter temporal scales than have been observed in
previously explored magnetospheric systems.

[3] The magnetopause is arguably the most important
boundary in the magnetospheric system for the reason that it
controls the flux of solar wind mass, energy, and momentum
into the magnetosphere. The magnetopause current sheet
forms as a result of the interaction between the incident solar
and planetary magnetic fields [Chapman and Ferraro,
1931]. Its location corresponds to the surface across which
the pressures of the internal magnetospheric magnetic fields
and charged particles are balanced by the external solar wind
pressure [Spreiter et al., 1966]. The pressure balance equation
for the magnetopause is

R MSP RB MSH
0 0 i

where [lg 1s the magnetic field permeability of free space,
B?/2119 denotes the pressure of the magnetic field B, and
the subscripts MSP and MSH designate the magnetosphere
and magnetosheath regions, respectively. The number density
and temperature of ions and electrons are represented by n;, 7;,
n,, and T,, respectively, where k is the Boltzmann constant,
and the sums are over all ionic species.

[4] Both Mercury and Earth have southward-directed
planetary dipoles, and their average magnetopause standoff
distances are ~1.4 Ry, [Ness et al., 1976; Russell, 1977;
Slavin et al., 2010; Moldovan et al., 2011] and ~10 Rx
(where Rp 1s Earth’s radius, or 6371 km) [Fairfield, 1971],
respectively. Hence, Earth occupies a much smaller volume
fraction of its magnetosphere than does Mercury. By
comparison, the combination of solar wind dynamic pressure
falling off as 1/° with increasing Heliocentric distance r
and stronger planetary dipole moments results in average
magnetopause standoff distances of 75 Ry (where Ry is Jupiter’s
radius) and 24 Rs (where Rg is Saturn’s radius) at Jupiter and
Saturn, respectively [Joy et al., 2002; Achilleos et al., 2008;
Went et al., 2011].

[5] Magnetic reconnection in the magnetopause current
layer, between the draped interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) in the magnetosheath and the intrinsic planetary field,
occurs at sites called X-lines [Dungey, 1961; Levy et al.,
1964]. This merging of magnetic field lines is responsible for
the transfer of magnetic flux from the dayside magnetosphere
into the magnetotail. Locally, such reconnection also heats
the charged particles, converts magnetic energy into kinetic
energy, and produces Alfvénic jets of plasma directed away
from the X-line along the magnetopause | F'uselier and Lewis,
2011]. When reconnection takes place at the magnetopause,
a component of the magnetic field B normal to the boundary
(Bx) is generated, creating a rotational discontinuity and
changing the configuration into a newly opened magnetosphere.
A finite By also enables some of the solar wind plasma to
cross the magnetopause and enter the magnetospheric system
[Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967; Sonnerup and Ledley, 1979;
Fuselier et al., 2005].

[6] The large-scale circulation of the terrestrial magnetosphere driven by solar wind interaction with the planetary
magnetic field is described as the Dungey cycle [Dungey,
1961]. This cycle, which is expected to be especially vigorous
at Mercury because of the strong solar wind close to the Sun
[Siscoe et al., 1975], begins with the process of magnetic
reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, as described
above. The new field lines, with one end attached to the planet

and the other in the solar wind, are pulled into the magnetotail,
where they reconnect once again before convecting back to the
dayside as a closed field, completing the sequence. Typical
Dungey cycle times are ~1 h at Earth but are much shorter at
Mercury, with convection times of only ~2 min [Siscoe et al.,
1975; Slavin et al., 2009, 2010].

[7] The rate of reconnection is often defined as the ratio of
the reconnection inflow velocity to the speed of the Alfvénic
outflow (Vin/Va) [Petschek, 1964; Sonnerup, 1974].
MESSENGER is not ideally instrumented to measure these
flows. However, the reconnection rate can also be expressed
as the ratio of the normal magnetic field component to the
total field just inside the magnetopause (By/Byp) [Sonnerup
et al., 198la] or using measurements of the tangential
electric field E, and plasma density p, (E,p!/?/Be,») [Mozer
and Retino, 2007]. At Earth, most reported values have been
from case studies and do not represent a statistical survey.
The results range from values on the order of 0.01 [Sonnerup
and Ledley, 1979; Mozer et al., 2002; Fuselier et al., 2005;
Fuselier et al., 2010] to a maximum of ~0.1 [Sonnerup
et al., 198la; Phan et al., 2001; Vaivads et al., 2004].
Furthermore, due to the relative weakness of the normal field
component compared with the background fluctuations and
uncertainties in the derivation of boundary-normal coordinates,
the reported By/Byyp values at Earth may be biased toward
events for which By 1s large. For example, using assumptions
to derive E,, Lindqvist and Mozer [1990] reported an average
reconnection rate of 0.15, but there was substantial scatter in
the data. In contrast, Phan et al. [1996] reported a survey
in which the mean J/;,/V, value was <0.01. In the most
extensive statistical study at Earth to date, Mozer and Retino
[2007] calculated an average reconnection rate of 0.046 for
22 events.

[3] Slavin and Holzer [1979] predicted high reconnection
rates at Mercury’s magnetopause on the basis of the low
Alfvén Mach number and decreased plasma f, the ratio of
total thermal pressure to magnetic pressure, 1n the inner solar
system. With increasing distance from the Sun, the solar
wind magnetic pressure decreases more rapidly than thermal
pressure [e.g., Slavin and Holzer, 1981]. As a result, the
solar wind Mach number grows and the plasma fs increases
between the orbits of Mercury and Earth.

[9] These changes result in the magnetosheath at Mercury
being strongly affected by magnetic stresses, whereas at
Earth and the more distant planets, the magnetosheath is
primarily influenced by plasma pressures [Paschmann et al.,
1986; Huddleston et al., 1997]. In turn, this behavior is
expected to cause the rate of reconnection between the IMF
in the magnetosheath and the planetary field to decrease with
distance from the Sun [Slavin and Holzer, 1979; Scurry and
Russell, 1991; Scurry et al., 1994; Mozer and Hull, 2010;
Masters et al., 2012]. An initial analysis of observations
during a MESSENGER flyby magnetopause crossing with
an incident magnetosheath of strong, steady southward IMF,
yielded a substantial By/Byp ratio of ~0.13 at Mercury| Slavin
et al., 2009 | that was larger than all but the most intense events
at Earth [e.g., Sonnerup et al., 198 1a].

[10] In this paper, we present an analysis of 43 dayside
magnetopause passes, during the first three Mercury years
of the MESSENGER mission orbital phase, with welldetermined By values. Magnetometer (MAG) [Anderson
et al., 2007] and Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS)

[Andrews et al., 2007] measurements taken during this
interval yielded a minimum of two dayside magnetopause
encounters per day as a result of MESSENGER’s 12-h orbit.
Because the magnetopause is constantly in motion at
velocities greater than the spacecraft, it is not unusual to see
multiple crossings for a single encounter. Each individual
crossing during this time period was systematically examined
with minimum variance analysis (MVA). Our extended
analysis confirms the initial MESSENGER results indicating
that reconnection is frequent and intense at Mercury. Our
results indicate that the low-6 magnetosheath at Mercury
[| Swisdak et al., 2010; Masters et al., 2012] enables reconnection
the majority of the time. Furthermore, we observe an
inverse relationship between magnetosheath plasma f and
reconnection rate.

2. Methodology

[11] From MESSENGER magnetic field data, with a
sampling rate of 20 s_', we identified magnetopause crossings
in Mercury solar magnetic (MSM) coordinates as sharp
discontinuities as the boundary moved past the spacecraft.
In MSM coordinates, the X)yjsy axis is directed from
Mercury’s offset magnetic dipole toward the center of the
Sun, the Zyjsm axis 1S normal to Mercury’s orbital plane
toward the north celestial pole, and the Yyisnyq axis completes
the right-handed system with the positive direction oriented
opposite to orbital motion. As at Earth, directional rotations
and a change in field magnitude serve as indicators of
magnetopause crossings. At low latitudes on the dayside,
the predominantly northward (+87) intrinsic field of the
planet has a typical magnitude of ~100 nT. The transition
from this stable dipole field to the more variable and
somewhat weaker field of the magnetosheath IMF usually
provides a distinct signature for magnetopause identification.
Because of the strong IMF and low plasma f in the inner
solar system, the magnetic field magnitude in Mercury’s
magnetosheath is often only slightly weaker than the field
inside the magnetosphere. This fact makes it difficult to
detect the magnetopause boundary for strongly northward
IMF (1.e., low values of the shear angle 6, defined as the
rotation of the magnetic field from the magnetosheath into the
magnetosphere). For this reason, we used the MESSENGER
plasma data to assist in the accurate identification of magnetopause crossings.

[12] FIPS measures time of flight, energy per charge (E/q),
and incident angle for ions within the ranges E/g = 0.05—13
keV e | and m/q = 1-60 amu e_', where m/q is the mass per
charge of detected ions. Near the magnetopause, the instrument
completes one scan over the entire range of E/g values every
8 s. FIPS has a conical field of view (FOV) of ~1.47 sr. The
instrument’s orientation with respect to the spacecraft sunshade
causes ~30% of the FOV to be obstructed and, depending on
its attitude, one of the solar panels may cause an additional
FOV obstruction. The reader is referred to Raines et al.
[2011] for further details on the FIPS FOV limitation and data
analysis procedures.

[13] The FIPS FOV direction with respect to the planet is
described in spherical coordinates whereby the polar angle
Oroy 18 the angle between the Zysm axis and the FIPS
boresight vector and ranges over 0°—180°. The azimuthal
angle droy 1s the angle between the X\ysjy axis and the FIPS

boresight vector and ranges over +180°; the sign of @rov
follows the sign of Yysm. There is considerable variation
in the orientation of FIPS for the magnetopause crossings
in this study (Figure 1). These changes in spacecraft pointing
are part of normal observations for other MESSENGER
instruments. FIPS orientations naturally fall into two groups,
on the basis of the sign of the Yyysy coordinate of the
spacecraft at the time of the crossing; those groups are
indicated on Figure 1.

[14] Strong decreases in the proton flux are typically
observed as MESSENGER crosses the magnetopause and
enters the magnetosphere. In this study, the change in flux
serves as an indicator of a magnetopause crossing. Conversely,
when MESSENGER exits the magnetosphere, increases
in proton counts and differential energy flux signal the
spacecraft’s entry into the dense, hot magnetosheath. The
effects of the FIPS orientation changes on the magnetopause
plasma signatures are expected to be minimal because of the
high contrast between the stagnant, hot plasma in the magnetosheath and the tenuous plasma inside the magnetosphere.

[15] In order to determine the structure of Mercury’s
magnetopause, MVA [Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967] was used

to transform the MAG measurements from MSM coordinates
into boundary-normal coordinates. The MVA _ technique
calculates the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a
magnetic field covariance matrix (V/ P) defined by

M?, = (BiBj) — (Bi) (Bi) (2)

where i, 7 = 1, 2, 3 correspond to the By, By, and Bz components of B in MSM coordinates and the brackets denote a temporal average. The resulting eigenvectors are orthogonal and
represent the directions of minimum, intermediate, and
maximum variance in the magnetic field. In the new coordinate
system, the minimum variance component (8;, which is
equivalent to By) is directed outward and normal to the local
magnetopause surface. The directions of intermediate (B82)
and maximum (B83) magnetic field variance lie within the
plane of the magnetopause and are free to rotate in response
to magnetic field variation to complete an orthogonal Cartesian
system.

[16] We utilize a discontinuity jump condition, according
to which the magnetic field magnitude is discontinuous but
the normal field component is continuous across the boundary,
whether that component is zero in the case of a tangential
discontinuity or a constant, nonzero value for the case of a
rotational discontinuity [Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967; Sonnerup
and Scheible, 1998]. Numerous studies have relied on the
magnitude of the normal component [e.g., Sonnerup et al.,
198la] to investigate the boundary configuration, whereas
others have differentiated between rotational and tangential
discontinuities on the basis of By/P;,; and AB, ot/Biot, Where Biot
is the total field magnitude and AB, is the change in
magnitude across the boundary [Lepping and Behannon,
1980; Knetter et al., 2004]. The latter method is designed
to separate rotational discontinuities with a modest By from
tangential discontinuities, but classification becomes difficult
when both of these ratios are small. For this study, our
interest in determining the intensity of magnetic reconnection
has led us to direct our attention to the substantial By
component prevalent at Mercury.

[17] The accuracy of the MVA transformation is inferred
from the number of vector measurements and the ratios of
the eigenvalues corresponding to the directions of minimum,
intermediate, and maximum variance: /;, 22, and 43. A high
ratio of intermediate to minimum eigenvalue (A>//,)
indicates a well-determined normal vector (and associated
eigenvector) acquired for a particular data set. There are
many approaches to determining the error associated with
the MVA principal axis directions [Sonnerup, 1971; Lepping
and Behannon, 1980; Hoppe et al., 1981; Kawano and
Higuchi, 1995; Khrabrov and Sonnerup, 1998]. Whereas the
bootstrap method performed by Kawano and Higuchi [1995]
proved to quantify the amount of error more accurately than
the method of Sonnerup [1971], the former technique requires
considerable computational power. Khrabrov and Sonnerup
[1998] developed an error estimation procedure that produces
results equivalent to the bootstrap method without the
associated computational requirements. Their method was
further developed by Sonnerup and Scheible [1998].

[18] We used the Sonnerup and Scheible [1998] method of
error estimation here to establish a criterion for acceptable
magnetopause crossings. In following this approach, we required A>/A, => 5 for crossings included in this study. Earlier

MVA studies required minimum eigenvalue ratios of 1.5—3
[Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967; Collier and Lepping, 1996].
To further refine the selection, we retained only those
crossings with a normal field component greater than or
equal to twice the uncertainty in By, indicating a rotational
discontinuity. Knetter et al. [2004] implemented a selection
criterion for solar wind discontinuities using a magnetic
shear angle threshold, 6 > 60°, in order to increase the
validity of the MVA results. However, reconnection rates
are hypothesized to be strongly dependent on shear angle,
and low-shear reconnection events are not uncommon for
interplanetary discontinuities [Gosling et al., 2007], as well
as for some solar wind-magnetosphere interactions [e.g.,
Paschmann et al., 1993]. Therefore, we required a large
A>/41, but we did not set a minimum shear angle. Additional
error estimation results are discussed below, following
two examples of magnetopause crossings that serve to
illustrate high-shear and low-shear open magnetosphere
configurations.

[19] For this study, a magnetopause crossing interval was
defined by first identifying the magnitude of the magnetic
field inside both the magnetosphere (Bysp) and the
magnetosheath (Bysy). These values served as guides to
determine the initial and final points of the interval. That
is, as the spacecraft exited the magnetosphere, the last
measurement to equal Byysp before the field rotation began
was designated as the “start” and the first measurement to
equal Byisy was the “stop.” This designation ensured that
we chose a full magnetopause crossing and avoided any
partial crossings that resulted from boundary dynamics. If
the magnetopause was being compressed toward the planet,
causing the spacecraft to re-enter the magnetosphere as
indicated by multiple crossings for a single encounter, Bysy
and Bysp signal the beginning and end of the interval,
respectively. The duration of a magnetopause crossing was
calculated from the time span of the MVA intervals. The
method of defining the MVA intervals ensured that the
duration captured the entirety of the current sheet with a full
rotation of the field.

3. MESSENGER Observations

3.1.

[20] Trajectories of the orbits from 21 and 24 November
2011 are displayed in Figure 2. The outbound crossings at the
dayside magnetopause occurred slightly after MESSENGER
reached periapsis and were chosen as a result of their close
proximity to the subsolar point. The magnetopause model
[Moldovan et al., 2011] was corrected for solar wind aberration
due to Mercury’s orbital velocity around the Sun, which varies
over the planet’s highly eccentric orbit.

[21] For the 24 November 2011 dayside pass, the magnetopause crossing was marked by a distinct shift in magnetic
field data at 10:29:04.49 UTC. After applying MVA to a 2.2
Ss interval spanning the magnetopause crossing, the normal
component of the magnetic field has a magnitude of
9.1 nT. The eigenvalue ratio indicated by the analysis,
Ao/A1 = 64.24, is well above the threshold value of 5 mentioned above, indicating that the normal direction is well
determined. The error analysis reveals an uncertainty of
+1 nT in the magnitude of By, calculated from the following [Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998]:

where N is the number of measured vectors and Ay); is the
expected angular uncertainty in the given normal direction,
indexed by intermediate and maximum directions 7. Since
the nonzero magnitude of By is greater than twice the
calculated error, this crossing was classified as a rotational
discontinuity and met the criteria for this study.

[22] The plasma and magnetic field data transformed into
boundary-normal coordinates are plotted for this crossing
in Figure 3. The minimum variance component B, 1s the
flattest and smoothest curve, whereas the direction of
maximum variance B3 shows a full rotation of the field
through the magnetopause. This rotation is indicated by a
change from positive to negative orientation with a large
shift in amplitude from ~+120 nT in the magnetosphere to
~—90 nT in the magnetosheath. The change in polarity
evident in B3 signifies a northward planetary field interacting
with a southward IMF—a configuration highly conducive to
dayside reconnection. The magnetopause shear angle was

calculated to be 148.9°. As the spacecraft entered the
magnetosheath, the plasma data showed an increase in the
number of proton counts. Furthermore, high values for
differential energy flux (red in Figure 3) spread across more
of the E/q range, indicating that the plasma was hotter in the
magnetosheath than inside the magnetosphere. Although
this example focuses on a single magnetopause crossing,
multiple crossings actually took place because of the
dynamic evolution of the boundary, as identified in the
figure.

[23] In contrast, the magnetopause crossing on 21 November
2011 (Figure 4) is an example of a low-shear magnetopause
reconnection event. A dominant northward Bz of ~145 nT just
inside the magnetopause 1s indicative of a compressed dayside
magnetosphere and higher than usual solar wind pressure. The
draped IMF in the magnetosheath exhibited a northward
orientation for the duration of the crossing. A magnetopause
crossing at 10:29:22.39 UTC was identified by a strong
increase in proton count rate over a wide range of energies
accompanied by a decrease in B3 and |B].

[24] The magnetic field data transformed by the MVA
results (Figure 4) of this 5.6 s interval show the rotation of
the field as the spacecraft traversed from the magnetosphere
into the magnetosheath region. The magnetopause current
sheet is defined by the abrupt change of ~10 nT in the B;
component, and the boundary-normal direction is well
determined as indicated by a ratio of intermediate to minimum
eigenvalue of 5.55. The analysis results in a normal
component with a magnitude of By = 6.7 nT. The error
analysis produces an uncertainty of +3.2 nT in the calculated
magnitude of By, which meets our definition of a rotational
discontinuity. Computing the shear between the fields of solar
and planetary origin indicates an extremely low shear angle of
? = 1.2° for this open magnetosphere configuration. The
plasma data reinforce the crossing identification and show a
sharp increase of nearly 10-fold in count rate across the
interval. For low-shear cases such as this, component
reconnection results in a highly inclined, north-south X-line
between the planetary and IMF fields [Sonnerup, 1974;
Fuselier et al., 2011].

3.2. Statistical Analysis

[25] The MVA-based analysis procedures described above
were applied to MAG and FIPS data from orbits during two
of MESSENGER’s “hot seasons,” when the periapsis of the
orbit was over Mercury’s subsolar region. We analyzed
15 days of magnetopause crossings during the first hot season, spanning the period from 15 May to 7 June 2011, and
21 days during the third hot season, from 8 to 28 November
2011. During 10 days of the first hot season, both instruments
were inoperative for the fraction of the orbit when MESSENGER
passed directly in front of the planet as a precaution against
excessive thermal inputs to the spacecraft. The first
continuous, simultaneous measurements by MAG and FIPS
were taken during the third hot season.

[26] For the intervals noted above, MVA was performed
on every distinct dayside magnetopause crossing exhibiting
a clear rotation as the field transitioned from a Bz magnitude
representative of the magnetosphere to that of the magnetosheath.
Magnetopause identification was confirmed by identifying
transitions in the plasma data that coincided with the field
rotation, from the tenuous magnetosphere into the hot, dense

crossings were identified. Of these, 65 met the eigenvalue
ratio criterion (A2/A; => 5). However, nine of these crossings

were eliminated because the field magnitude in the
magnetosheath exceeded that of the magnetosphere. The

of large, rapid changes in solar wind pressure that are incompatible with the assumptions made for our single-satellite
analysis techniques. From the remaining 56 crossings, three
were excluded because the error in By was larger than 8 nT.
Finally, 10 more crossings were removed for having a normal
field component that was less than twice the uncertainty in By.
We determined that 48% of the crossings 1n our initial set were
rotational discontinuities on the basis of these stringent
requirements to account for single-spacecraft limitations. This
procedure admits the possibility that some of the 49 eliminated
cases were also rotational discontinuities, but their inability to
meet the criteria listed above caused them to be rejected.
Therefore, we cannot say how often the magnetopause is a
rotational discontinuity, but our survey indicates that this
configuration is not uncommon.

[27] The locations of the 43 selected crossings fall within
the confines of the subsolar region between 0800 and 1600
local time and +20° latitude. These magnetopause crossings
are compared with the boundary model of Moldovan et al.
[2011] in Figure 5. The magnetopause model is projected
onto the terminator plane (X\ysm = 0 Rm) in Figure 5b to
illustrate boundary location from the perspective of the
Sun. Close agreement between the location of the crossings
considered here and those predicted by the model of Moldovan
et al. [2011] 1s evident.

[28] In order to characterize the magnetopause, a statistical
analysis was applied to the 43 crossings with well-determined
boundary normals. Figure 6a displays a histogram of the ratios
of intermediate to minimum eigenvalue from the surveyed
dayside crossings, indicating an average value of 14 and a
lower limit of 5, as predetermined by the selection criteria.
This distribution strongly supports the validity of the normal
directions derived from MVA. The corresponding results from
the error analysis, illustrated in Figure 6b with an average error
of 2.21 + 0.20 nT, validate the confidence in the selected
events. The standard error, in this case £0.20 nT, is calculated
from the ratio of the standard deviation to the square root of
the number of events (¢/\/N) and is implemented for all
succeeding calculations.

[30] The average duration of the magnetopause crossings
was calculated from the time span of the MVA intervals,
as discussed in section 2. The mean, 5 s, is comparable to
the standard deviation, 4 s, and most likely indicative of
the natural variability in the normal magnetopause velocity
(Vx), which we cannot measure directly. During several
longer encounters, the magnetopause and the spacecraft
were likely to have been moving simultaneously, causing
an extended rendezvous. Figure 8 displays a histogram of
magnetopause crossing durations.

[31] At the reconnection X-line, magnetic flux is delivered
to the diffusion region at the plasma inflow speed (Vj,).
Following reconnection, the newly created open flux tubes
leave the diffusion region at the outflow jet velocity, which
is equal to the Alfvén speed (V,). The rate of magnetic flux
transport into the X-line V;,B)yp and the transport in the
outflow region V,By must match:

D = Vy By = VinBup (5)

where ® is the intensity or rate of reconnection. However,
for many purposes, it is desirable to use a dimensionless
reconnection rate « [Sonnerup et al., 198la; Mozer and

This dimensionless reconnection rate « removes the dependence of flux transfer rate on the strength of the magnetic
field and the Alfvén speed, but not other intrinsic factors
such as magnetic field shear angle or plasma f. Figure 9
displays the distribution of the inferred reconnection rate
By/Byp from the 43 accepted magnetopause crossings. The
average ratio of 0.15 + 0.02 is ~3 times larger than the best

4. Discussion

[32] In this paper, MVA has been applied to magnetic field
data acquired by the MESSENGER spacecraft as it crossed
the dayside magnetopause boundary. These boundaries were
identified in the Magnetometer data and confirmed with
FIPS plasma measurements. This procedure allowed the
identification of magnetopause crossings with significant
By, even under low-shear conditions. MVA appears well
suited to the study of magnetopause reconnection at
Mercury by virtue of the strong magnetic fields in the inner
solar system. Just as at Earth, there are some cases for which
large temporal variations or extremely large-amplitude
fluctuations result in a poorly determined boundary normal.
Furthermore, if a northward IMF threads the magnetosheath
such that it has a magnitude comparable to that of the
planetary field and is parallel to the field inside the magnetosphere, then the vanishing field shear and gradient can make
boundary identification impossible, especially if KelvinHelmholtz waves are present.

[33] International Sun-Earth Explorer and Cluster multispacecraft observations have shown that the magnetopause
thickness at Earth is on the order of 5—10 gyroradii for a solar wind proton in the magnetosheath [Berchem and Russell,
1982; Haaland et al., 2004], as predicted by single particle
motion [ Willis, 1975]. The gyroradi of solar wind protons
(H') at Mercury are calculated to be 16 km for typical
magnetic field strengths inside the magnetopause and a
magnetosheath plasma temperature of 10° K. If, following
Masters et al. [2011], we assume an average magnetopause
thickness of seven proton gyroradii, the mean magnetopause thickness at Mercury is ~100 km. Given the observed duration of ~5 s in the MESSENGER observations,
the calculated magnetopause velocity is 20 km s‘. This
value is well within the range of terrestrial multispacecraft
observations [e.g., Russell and Elphic, 1978]. The calculated
thickness of ~100 km for Mercury’s magnetopause is much
less than that of any other planet possessing an intrinsic
magnetic field, e.g., ~400—1000 km for Earth [Russell and
Elphic, 1978; Berchem and Russell, 1982], ~3500—5200
km at Jupiter [Sonnerup et al., 1981b], and ~5000 km as estimated from surface waves at Saturn [Lepping et al., 1981].

1004
DIBRACCIO ET AL.: MAGNETOPAUSE RECONNECTION AT MERCURY

[34] The normal component of the magnetic field at the
magnetopause, with a mean value of 20.1 nT, is in agreement
with the MESSENGER flyby results of Slavin et al. [2009]
and supports the high rates of reconnection and ~2 min time
scale computed for the convection of energy, plasma, and
magnetic flux in Mercury’s Dungey cycle. This time scale
was inferred from the cross-magnetosphere electric potential
drop calculated from By and confirmed by the direct
observation of ~1- to 3-min-long intervals of tail loading and
unloading [Slavin et al., 2010].

[35] The dependence of the computed reconnection rate
on the magnetopause shear angle is displayed in Figure 10.
We have calculated the average reconnection rate over
intervals of 30° (red) to examine the variance of the individual
events from the overall average reconnection rate of 0.15. For
the crossings examined in this study, the magnetopause shear
angle ranges over 1°—170°, but as indicated by the binned
averages, there is minimal variation among the calculated
reconnection rates. In contrast with studies of Earth’s
magnetopause [Fuselier and Lewis, 2011], our results indicate
that the dimensionless reconnection rate at Mercury does not
increase with an increase in shear angle. Instead, By/Byp
remains constrained between 0.1 and 0.3 for the majority of
the events with a mean of 0.15. Even the events with the
lowest shear angle (0°—30°) have an average reconnection rate
of ~0.1.

[36] Previous studies have explored other factors that
control the occurrence and intensity of reconnection at
Earth, including plasma f, solar wind Mach number, and
magnetopause shear angle [Sonnerup, 1974; Scurry and
Russell, 1991; Scurry et al., 1994; Trenchi et al., 2008].
Sonnerup [1974] described how reconnection is. still
possible when field lines are not antiparallel but instead are
positioned at only a small angle @ with respect to each other.
For reconnection to occur at such low shear angles, the
magnetic fields on either side of the magnetopause must
have an equal field component parallel to the reconnection

indicating that reconnection occurs at Mercury for a large
range of shear angles.

components are then oriented in the same or opposite direction.
However, these conditions for low shear reconnection are
best met when the magnetic fields on either side of the current
sheet are similar in magnitude as, for example, occurs at the
interplanetary current sheet [Gosling et al., 2007; Phan
et al., 2010]. This effect at Mercury was illustrated in the
low-shear magnetopause reconnection example in Figure 4,
a case for which the field magnitudes on either side of the
magnetopause differed by less than 10%. We suggest that
the underlying reason for the strong magnetic fields in
Mercury’s magnetosheath is the low Alfvénic Mach number,
M, ~ 3-4, in the inner solar system [Slavin and Holzer,
1979]. Under these conditions, the electromagnetic terms in
the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are more
important than for high-M, conditions. For example, as the
IMF encounters the magnetopause, there is a tendency for fb
to decrease as the plasma is lost to flow along the draped flux
tubes, which leads to the formation of a plasma depletion
layer (PDL) [e.g., Anderson and Fuselier, 1993]. As first
described by Zwan and Wolf [1976], the PDL is greatly
enhanced for low solar wind Alfvén Mach number such as
is found at Mercury, a result supported by global hybrid
and MHD simulations [Travnicek et al., 2010; Benna et al.,
2010].

[37] A statistical survey of the terrestrial magnetopause by
Scurry et al. [1994] showed that a low-f environment is
required for low-shear reconnection. It has also been
established that the frequency of reconnection is higher for
both low-f and low-M, conditions [Trenchi et al., 2008], a
result attributed to the fact that reconnection is possible over
a wider range of shear angles under these conditions. To
understand why f in the magnetosheath affects the range
of shear angles at which magnetopause reconnection may
occur, Swisdak et al. [2003] used particle-in-cell simulations
to study asymmetric reconnection in collisionless plasmas.
Their results showed that a diamagnetic drift, produced
when a pressure gradient is present across the current sheet,
prompts advection of the reconnection X-line and may
inhibit reconnection when the drift velocity is super-Alfvénic
(Vs > Va). Swisdak et al. [2003] found that reconnection is
more likely to be suppressed for cases of high M,, and they
established a condition on /-dependent diamagnetic effects,

By 2L

p> Bup di;

(7)
where L represents the pressure scale length and d; is the ion
inertial length. This relation implies that magnetic reconnection
is prevented at high values of 6, even when a substantial guide
field is present. However, in the low-f case at Mercury, we can
expect a high occurrence of reconnection for a wide range of
shear angles.

[38] The condition in equation (7) was reformulated to
relate the restriction of reconnection to the magnetic shear
angle:

ap > Ftan( 5) (8)

where Af is the change in plasma f across the current layer
[Swisdak et al., 2010]. As part of a study of magnetopause
reconnection at Saturn, Masters et al. [2012] measured the
magnetized plasma conditions to explore whether the

1005
DIBRACCIO ET AL.: MAGNETOPAUSE RECONNECTION AT MERCURY

parameters satisfy the diamagnetic suppression condition
(equation 8). With the majority of the events meeting this criterion, they determined that high-/ conditions restrict reconnection at the planet.

[39] It is possible to calculate f in the magnetosheath for
our chosen magnetopause crossings by assuming that the
plasma pressure inside the magnetosphere is negligible.
After applying this assumption to the rotational discontinuity
pressure balance given in equation (1), we are able to
determine the magnetosheath plasma pressure:

B B
MSP _ “MSH (9)

This value may then be used to calculate the ratio of the
plasma pressure to magnetic pressure in the magnetosheath:

where fysy is the plasma f in the magnetosheath.
Since we are assuming f = 0 inside the magnetosphere,
AP = Pusu — bsp = Bsn:

[40] The calculated [/)yjsq and measured shear angle are
compared in Figure lla using the relation of equation (8)
for L = d;. This relation separates the parameter space into
two regions denoting whether reconnection is possible or
suppressed. Above the curve, the diamagnetic suppression
condition is not satisfied, and reconnection is possible
according to the necessary, but not sufficient, low-f
requirement. In the region below the curve, the f-shear
condition for diamagnetic suppression is satisfied, and
reconnection is prevented. The majority of the low-f events
lie above the curve, including all crossings with reconnection
rates of >0.25 (red triangles), suggesting conditions that are
favorable for reconnection, a result in agreement with the
conclusions of Masters et al. [2012] for high fb. Furthermore,
a comparison of {4s With the reconnection rate in Figure 1 1b
demonstrates that instances of high By/Byp occur for low-f
cases, in correspondence with the results of Scurry et al.
[1994].

The average value of 29 kV is in good agreement with the
30 kV estimate derived from measurements taken during
MESSENGER’s second flyby of Mercury [S/avin et al.,
2009]. It is also lower than typical values for the magnetospheric potential drop of about 60 kV at Earth [Lindqvist
and Mozer, 1990], 250 kV at Jupiter, and 45 kV at Saturn
[Badman and Cowley, 2007], consistent with the smaller
magnetosphere dimensions but stronger IMF and reconnection
rate at Mercury.

[43] We conclude that Mercury’s dayside magnetopause is
frequently experiencing reconnection as a result of the low-f

and low-M, conditions in the magnetosheath associated
with the planet’s location in the inner heliosphere. This
environment facilitates reconnection over a wide range of
magnetopause shear angles and contributes to a high
reconnection rate and, for its small dimensions, a high
magnetospheric potential. As a result, Mercury’s magnetosphere is subjected to the most intense solar wind forcing
of any planet in the solar system.
