<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, many studies have attempted to characterize the Martian shock position and shape and its evolution under various solar wind and EUV conditions <ref type="bibr">(Hall et al., 2019 and references therein)</ref>. Two missions have been used for this goal, the ESA/Mars Express mission and the NASA/MAVEN mission. Mars Express (hereafter MEX for brevity) was launched in 2003 and has been orbiting Mars since 2004, whereas MAVEN was launched 10 yr later in November 2013 and has been orbiting the planet since 22 September 2014. MAVEN's scientific payload includes among others a fluxgate magnetometer (MAG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Connerney et al., 2015)</ref>, two ion spectrometers including the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Halekas et al., 2015)</ref> and the Suprathermal and Thermal Ion Composition instrument <ref type="bibr">(STATIC, McFadden et al., 2015)</ref>, and an electron spectrometer (Solar Wind Electron Analyzer, SWEA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mitchell et al., 2016)</ref>. MEX unfortunately does not carry any magnetometer but includes a plasma suite (ions and electrons) as part of the ASPERA-3 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barabash et al., 2006)</ref>, which was used to investigate the plasma boundaries at Mars <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dubinin et al., 2006)</ref>. Both missions aim at studying the upper atmosphere and the magnetospheric environment of Mars.</p><p>Detections of the bow shock in spacecraft data have relied on manual determinations using as many instruments (including plasma instruments and magnetometer) as available to avoid ambiguous detections <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gruesbeck et al., 2018)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Němec et al. (2020)</ref> proposed a region identification scheme based on selected plasma parameters and applied their technique to the MAVEN dataset in order to identify upstream solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere regions crossed by the spacecraft. This method has the advantage of mapping these regions statistically, removing certain biases usually associated with manually picked individual boundary crossings which may be orbit-dependent. However, it requires the reliable knowledge of flow speed, ion density and magnetic field, which may not all always be available. A parallel trend has also been to apply machine-learning techniques to plasma data for the labeling and identification of the regions crossed by a given spacecraft (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Breuillard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">for Mars and Earth, respectively)</ref>, as part of online databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Génot et al., 2021)</ref>. However, these studies require extensive amounts of time and patience, as well as large computer resources to become efficient. Sometimes, a precise determination of the shock position in the data is not of paramount importance and simpler, faster, more straightforward approaches, such as the one presented in this study, can be advantageous. This may be the case in statistical studies where one of those regions needs to be systematically excluded, as in space weather databases monitoring the solar wind. This can also be of interest when areas around the predicted bow shock must be excluded for qualified reasons, as in wave studies focusing on regions outside of foreshock and shock wake structures, or when a first guess of the location and geometry of the shock is needed.</p><p>We present in this study new, simple analytical algorithms using two types of historical fitting techniques (2D and 3D), which make it possible to quickly estimate from spacecraft spatial coordinates the statistical geometrical position of the shock in planetary atmospheres. Special emphasis on the Martian environment and the MAVEN dataset is given throughout, however the method is applicable to any planetary environment and spacecraft dataset. This first crude estimator can be refined further by applying additional criteria, for example, on the magnetic field amplitude measured by the MAVEN spacecraft. This provides a fast means to approximately and quite reliably identify the position of the shock so that solar wind and magnetosheath regions can be studied on a statistical level in the data. Moreover, other characteristics of the shock crossing, such as the quasi-parallel (q ‖ ) or quasi-perpendicular (q ⊥ ) geometry of the shock can easily be obtained by deriving the perpendicular direction to the shock at any point on the surface.</p><p>After a review of 2D and 3D bow shock fitting models at Mars in Section 2, we present in a consistent manner the leading equations behind these models in 2D and 3D, give the analytical expressions for standoff distances, and propose a geometric calculation of the normal to the bow shock at any point on the surface. Starting in Section 3, we introduce a predictor algorithm for a fast estimation of the shock position in spacecraft orbital coordinates and its timing (Section 3.1). In Section 3.2, we propose a simple correction on this position and timing with the sole help of magnetometer data (predictor-corrector algorithm). Application to the MAVEN MAG dataset is then given as validation on a few examples and then extended to the whole available dataset. Finally, as a result of the automatic detection proposed here, statistical analytical fits are given for the MAVEN mission between</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Bow Shock Models at Mars</head><p>In this section, following a survey of existing fitting models at Mars, we present comprehensive formulae for analytical fits in 2D polar coordinates and 3D Cartesian coordinates, with a calculation of bow shock subsolar and terminator standoff distances. We also show how to calculate the normal to the surface at a given point in space, in order to estimate the q ⊥ − q ‖ shock conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Coordinate Systems and Solar Wind Flow Aberration</head><p>All spacecraft coordinates in this study are in Mars Solar Orbital coordinates (MSO) for simplicity, in accordance with most previous studies. In the MSO system, identical to the Sun-state coordinate system, the +X MSO axis points toward the Sun from the planet's center, +Z MSO is toward Mars' North pole and perpendicular to the orbital plane defined as the X MSO -Y MSO plane passing through the center of Mars, and Y MSO completes the orthogonal system.</p><p>Because of the orbital motion of Mars with respect to the average direction of the solar wind, the apparent direction of the solar wind in the rest frame of the planet deviates from the anti-sunward direction. As a result, an anti-clockwise rotation by an angle α around the Z axis must be applied so that the bow shock's major axis is aligned with respect to the X axis along the solar wind flow. This aberration, first seen in cometary tails and at the origin of the hypothesis by Biermann of a stellar wind <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Biermann, 1951)</ref>, is taken into account in the so-called aberrated MSO coordinates, denoted 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 ′ MSO , 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 ′ MSO , and 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 ′ MSO (although Z is left unchanged by the transformation). To unclutter notations, the "MSO" subscript is now dropped. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Formisano et al. (1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Slavin and Holzer (1981)</ref> define the angle 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 as 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴= arctan ( 𝑉𝑉p∕𝑣𝑣sw ) where V p is Mars' orbital velocity and 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴sw is the solar wind velocity, for example expressed in km s −1 . Mars' average orbital velocity is 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴p = 24.07 26.5  22.0 km s −1 . For the maximum value (26.5 km s −1 ), the angle is α = 3.8° for a typical solar wind speed of 400 km s −1 . The angle assumed by all studies except those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Slavin and Holzer (1981)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Slavin et al. (1991)</ref> is 4°. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Slavin and Holzer (1981)</ref>, the aberration angle was chosen to be varying with solar wind speed conditions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Slavin et al. (1991)</ref>, α = 3.2°. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the aberration angle with respect to orbital velocity (abscissa) and to solar wind velocity (color code). </p></div>

Orbital coverage of MEX is shown in their Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>. No discrimination with solar cycle or MY is given, although EUV flux and solar-wind parameter dependence are studied. f Data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hall et al.

(1991)</ref> showed that the terminator distance, which is a marker of the swelling of the cavity flanks, varied by as much as 11% between the Mars-2, 3, 5 observations (low activity) and the Phobos-2 observations (high activity), although the number of crossings for each mission largely differed. Mars EXpress (MEX), with its very long activity spanning the end of solar cycle 23 and cycle 24 up to now (toward the beginning of new cycle 25), had the best chance to conclusively solve this aspect: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hall et al. (2019)</ref> found that for the years 2004-2017, the terminator distance underwent variations up to ∼7%, in agreement with the preliminary results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Trotignon et al. (1993)</ref>. Of note, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mazelle et al. (2004)</ref> made a review of all available measurements before MEX started observing, and discussed the solar cycle variations and the differences observed with Venus (for which up to 35% increases of the bow shock location in the terminator plane with increasing activity have been reported, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Edberg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Russell et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Of great import, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Edberg et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Edberg et al. ( , 2010) )</ref> used MGS and MEX data in combination with ACE data extrapolated to Mars to study the dependence of the bow shock location to solar EUV flux and magnetosonic Mach number (noted M ms ). They pointed out that the shape of the magnetosonic shock wave depends on the ratio of the solar wind speed to the magnetosonic speed. Later, for the entire period <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">2004</ref><ref type="bibr">-2015</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hall et al. (2016) )</ref> identified 11,861 crossings in the MEX database, using electron spectrometer data with machine-learning algorithms. This study was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hall et al. (2019)</ref> up to 2017 with a total of 13,585 crossings, totaling 13 yr of operations of MEX. Both works used a standard 2D conic fit depending on the Mars Year (MY), with observed variations up to a few percent in terms of standoff bow shock distance. In addition to solar wind cycle variations and hemispherical changes from a 2D perspective, these studies confirmed the dependence of the shock position with P sw and, most drastically, with solar EUV flux. Correspondingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ramstad et al. (2017)</ref> studied with coincident electron and ion data a subset of only 1,083 inbound and outbound MEX orbits for the period 2005-2016. They evaluated the dependence of the Induced Magnetospheric Boundary (IMB) and bow shock (BS) to EUV flux and the solar wind's lowest moments (density and bulk velocity), showing that the BS mostly expands and contracts with the IMB. However, they also found that the BS swelling in the flank due to increased EUV fluxes cannot be solely explained by a corresponding swelling of the IMB. Simultaneously with MAVEN with both magnetometer and ion measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halekas et al. (2017)</ref> investigated how the Martian magnetosphere and bow shock responded to EUV flux, M ms , and P sw between October 2014 and May 2016 (0.85 MY). In agreement with previous studies, they showed that the shock inflates with increasing EUV flux and contracts with increasing dynamic pressure and M ms ; this in turn leads to EUV flux and dynamic pressure competing against one another because of their common 𝐴𝐴 1∕𝑑𝑑 2 ℎ dependence on heliocentric distance d h . Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Němec et al. (2020)</ref> used MAVEN plasma and magnetometer data to construct maps of the solar wind/ magnetosheath regions. Their modeled bow shock locations, explicitly dependent on P sw , EUV flux, and crustal field intensities, were in good agreement with the average fits of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Trotignon et al. (2006)</ref>, with appreciable differences in terminator extensions as compared to the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ramstad et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Broadly speaking, two approaches fitting the shape of bow shocks have historically been employed, one using a simple 2D polar form (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Slavin &amp; Holzer, 1981)</ref>, the other the 3D general Cartesian conic form (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Formisano, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Formisano et al., 1979)</ref>.

Thus, the angle of importance is the angle between the average IMF vector upstream of the shock and the shock normal. This angle is in the literature almost always named θ Bn , which is kept here for convenience. The geometry of the shock is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Bn &gt; 45 • ∶ ⟂ shock (14) Bn ≤ 45 • ∶ ‖ shock (15)</formula><p>Starting in the magnetic field compression region in the solar wind, q ⊥ shocks have structures, from the point of view of B-fields, almost always characterized by (a) a foot, (b) a fast ramp, and (c) a wider overshoot followed by a more gradual undershoot (see <ref type="bibr">Kennel et al., 1985, Figure 11)</ref>. This classic picture is a first approximation as fine electron-scale structures in the foreshock, foot and ramp can be seen with high-cadence magnetic field measurements. Q ⊥ shocks reflect particles back upstream to satisfy the shock conditions and are on average diffusive. Magnetic structures trapping particles such as mirror modes are observed to predominantly take place in the magnetosheath behind a q ⊥ shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gary, 1992)</ref>. On the other hand, q ‖ shocks are on average resistive and are usually characterized by heavy turbulence. Their foreshock contains MHD turbulence that can give rise to first-order Fermi acceleration. Also common in the foreshock region, highly compressive structures such as Short Large-Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are associated with large density variations: they originate from the steepening of ULF waves and are of great importance in the shock reformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burgess et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burgess &amp; Scholer, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In order to determine the q ‖ or q ⊥ geometry of the shock crossed by a spacecraft, the normal direction to the shock surface needs to be first estimated.

The accuracy of the geometrical method presented here is linked to the assumption that the shock surface is smooth and does not possess any kinks or local structures where the current curls on itself. In practice, we do not expect such a smooth surface as the shock may assume a more rippled shape which depends on the upstream solar wind condition and the turbulence at the boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Moullard et al., 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Detecting the Bow Shock in Spacecraft Orbits</head><p>Estimating the bow shock position from spacecraft spatial coordinates can be achieved either empirically or theoretically, depending on the precision needed. Semi-empirical but computationally intensive techniques using machine-learning imaging algorithms are currently attempted to detect automatically and precisely the exact position of the shock. Such techniques make use of the full plasma instrumental payload on board planetary missions, when available. Other techniques like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Němec et al. (2020)</ref> use ion and magnetic field data in combination to statistically identify the regions crossed by the spacecraft. However, a faster approach, based on a simple geometrical estimator using a static analytical bow shock model (see Section 2), may still prove valuable for statistical studies or for new datasets. We present such an approach and its possible refinements in 2D and 3D coordinate systems based on magnetic field-only measurements. Because in the following we do not take into ac-count plasma measurements, and because the true signature of the shock may be difficult to detect with magnetic field data only, a range of simultaneous criteria to identify solar wind and magnetosheath regions is required to mitigate this ambiguity. These criteria are presented in Section 3.2.</p></div>

To help identify the solar wind region, we can distinguish between trajectories moving from the magnetosheath to the solar wind region, and vice-versa.

At 1 s resolution, we predicted a total of 16,515 bow shock crossings using the 3D analytical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruesbeck et al. (2018)</ref> for the MAVEN dataset between November 2014 and February 2021, including 8,256 crossings from the sheath to the solar wind and 8,259 crossings from the solar wind to the sheath.</p><p>Actual crossings may in practice be different than the predictions and the algorithms may fail to pinpoint the location of the shock sometimes by several tens of minutes, mostly because of solar wind varying conditions, or due to the geometry of the shock at the point of passage for an individual orbit <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Halekas et al., 2017)</ref>. We estimate thus the precision of these automatic estimates to be of the order of ±0.08R p (±270 km) around the "true" bow shock location, from a representative subset of data. Because of variable shock position from orbit to orbit and the geometric average nature of the detection, some orbits that may have experienced shock crossings but lie inside the average shock position will not be tested for potential detection. It is estimated that only a few hundred potential crossings were ignored in the process. Consequently, the true shock structure location should be checked directly in the magnetic field and plasma data. Moreover, since the bow shock is a dynamical object, it may experience fast forward and backward motions, crossing the spacecraft trajectory several times more per orbit. This can be seen, for example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>, where the total magnetic field undergoes sharp intermittent jumps in the foreshock area (23 June 2018, around 01:00 UT).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Refining the Position of the Shock: A Predictor-Corrector Algorithm</head><p>Because of variations in the shock position, the automatic detection may give inaccurate predictions. We present here a fast method to correct to a certain extent for these discrepancies. It makes use of the magnitude of B to identify the position of the shock structure, either when crossing from the magnetosheath into the solar wind or vice-versa. As before, the main assumption is that the shock is crossed twice per orbit at maximum, although in practice the shock structure may be crossed several times due to the fast motion of the boundary across the spacecraft trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Halekas et al., 2017)</ref>. As we are interested in the statistical position of the shock, this assumption nonetheless provides a valuable estimate of the average position of the shock during those times. All magnetic field data are assumed here to be of the order of 1 s resolution. From the point of view of a single spacecraft's magnetic field measurements across the shock boundary, the total magnetic field intensity increases sharply, from typically 5 to 10 nT in the solar wind at Mars to about twice that level on average when moving into the magnetosheath. Additionally, fluctuations increase, going from small standard deviations around the mean in the solar wind, to comparatively larger fluctuations in the magnetosheath. Typical crossings of the Martian shock illustrating these behaviors are shown, for example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> which presents examples of bow shock crossings around Mars as seen with the MAG instrument on board MAVEN throughout the mission. As discussed in Section 2.3, q ⊥ shocks usually display distinct features (foot, sharp ramp, and overshoot) as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, 6b, and 6d, whereas q ‖ geometries have less clear signatures in magnetic . The first crossing is quite oblique (θ Bn ≈ 45°) followed by two highly q ⊥ shock crossings (θ Bn 𝐴𝐴 𝐴 85°). (b) 23-24 September 2016. The two detected crossings are q ⊥ , the first one with θ Bn ≈ 58°, the second with θ Bn ≈ 78°. (c) 23 June 2018, with two detected q ‖ crossings (θ Bn ≈ 8, 25°). (d) 28 March 2020, with five crossings all oblique toward q ⊥ conditions, with θ Bn ≈ 45°, 49°, 80°, 82°, and 88°, successively. The predictor geometric detections (Section 3.1) are in dashed lines and labeled "automatic," whereas the predictorcorrector detections proposed in Section 3.2 are in solid lines. Highlighted in different colors are crossings from solar wind to magnetosheath (labeled SW → MS, red) and from magnetosheath to solar wind (labeled MS → SW, blue).

Consequently, the corrector method presented here is biased toward the detection of q ⊥ crossings.</p><p>Our predictor-corrector detection algorithm attempts to consistently identify solar wind undisturbed regions in the chosen dataset, characterized by relatively low magnetic field intensities in combination with small fluctuations. For each orbit of a spacecraft, it proceeds as follows, with user-defined values (Δt bs , B th , T, and ς th ) discussed afterward:</p><p>1. Calculate predictor estimate of the shock crossing time t bs with the automatic algorithm in 2D aberrated polar coordinates or in 3D (as in Section 3.1). 2. If t bs exists in the considered orbit, choose a small time interval symmetric around the estimated shock so that [t bs − Δt bs , t bs + Δt bs ] (user-defined). 3. Calculate a robust estimate of the average magnetic field, for example, the median of the magnetic field in half of this interval, noted |B sw | 1/2 . By definition |B sw | 1/2 corresponds to the assumed solar wind region magnetic field. For crossings from the solar wind into the sheath, the first half-interval is selected. For crossings from the sheath to the solar wind, the second half-interval is selected. There are two possibilities at this junction: (a) If |B sw | 1/2 &gt; B th , where B th is the solar wind-to-magnetosheath threshold (user-defined), the position of the solar wind region is difficult to assess. In that case: i. Make the time interval float around the estimated location of the shock, by increments of Δt bs /3 in one direction or the other, so that t bs = t bs ± Δt bs /3, ii. Repeat interval shift until |B sw | 1/2 ≤ B th or until a maximum shift of 2Δt bs is effected from the estimated shock timing in either direction. If |B sw | 1/2 &gt; B th still, either the spacecraft is always in the sheath or in an usually high solar wind B-field region, in which case the crossing is altogether ignored and removed from the database. If not, go to step (b): (b) If |B sw | 1/2 ≤ B th , this half-interval is a good candidate for undisturbed solar wind conditions. In that case:</p><p>i. Calculate the running Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) ς mad,B of the total B-field signal over a temporal window of duration T (user-defined) in the chosen half-interval, and smooth further the result with a running median over a time span enclosing the shock structure in its entirety (e.g., 2T or 3T). This also helps remove potentially abrupt but temporally isolated changes in the signal. Note that this particular choice of ς mad,B is somewhat arbitrary. After several tests including running standard deviations, normalized or not to the "solar wind" signal, the choice of a smoothed running MAD was empirically found to work consistently well with the MAVEN dataset at 1s resolution. For all times t at which the total magnetic field B tot is measured over a running interval [t i , t i + T]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">𝜍𝜍mad,B(𝑡𝑡) = ⟨ median ( | | | | 𝐵𝐵tot(𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖) − median 𝑇𝑇 (𝐵𝐵tot) | | | | )⟩ ∀𝑡𝑡 ∈ [𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝑇𝑇 ]<label>(24)</label></formula><p>ii. Compare ς mad,B to threshold value ς th (user-defined). A jump above a certain threshold ς th indicates a transition between a less turbulent region (ς mad,B &lt; ς th ) to a more turbulent one (ς mad,B &gt; ς th ), an indicator of the presence of a shock-like structure. If this threshold is reached, take the first (respectively, last) time this happens in the chosen interval for solar wind-to-sheath (respectively, sheath-to-solar wind) crossings, and correct the original timing t bs of step 1 to new t bs, corr . If not, discard crossing. (c) Repeat for each orbit.</p><p>At Mars, we tested step 1 (predictor) in the previous section with the MAVEN dataset: on average, the detected shock was within ±0.08R p (±270 km) of the true shock crossing, corresponding to about ±30 min of data along the orbit. We thus set the interval of study for the corrector algorithm to Δt bs = 30 min. This value depends on the orbit inclination with respect to the bow shock surface and is thus mission-dependent.</p><p>We determined the typical user-defined threshold values for the MAVEN mission manually, for simplicity, on a reduced dataset. We found a good compromise by trial and error with B th = 11 nT, because the undisturbed solar wind magnetic field in Mars' vicinity is of the order of 2-6 nT on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Slavin &amp; Holzer, 1981)</ref>, but can reach up to about 10 nT or more when solar transient effects such as coronal mass ejections or co-rotating interaction regions are involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>. In future studies, a more dynamic criterion in step (3a) may be preferred, that is, where the amplitude of the magnetic field is normalized to the assumed upstream solar wind value. The criterion for being in the magnetosheath could, for example, become 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 = |𝐁𝐁|∕|𝐵𝐵sw|1/2 &gt; 𝐴𝐴th , where γ th is an ad-equately chosen threshold (γ ∼ 1.5 for a clear increase of magnetic field when moving into the magnetosheath, with nominal solar wind levels γ ∼ 1).</p><p>Because the shock appears in measurements as a turbulent structure whereas the solar wind is on average less so, step (3b-i) calculates a measure of the variability of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the shock. The value of T is also mission-and instrument-dependent; for MAVEN/MAG data at a resolution of 1 s, a value T = 120 s was chosen, which adequately captures the mean magnetic field variations. When in the solar wind, we found that the intrinsic variability of the signal ς mad,B , calculated over a running window of duration T = 120 s, was average &lt;0.5, which is adopted as the threshold ς th . This makes it possible to detect the very first perturbations in the solar wind leading to the creation of the shock structure, a point which is identified here as the position of the shock proper at time t bs . Again, in future studies, the threshold can be normalized to the magnetic field level, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halekas et al. (2017)</ref> where, together with constraints on plasma parameters, the normalized rootsum-squared value of the magnetic field was chosen so that RSS(B)/|B| &lt; 0.15 to identify undisturbed solar wind intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Application to MAVEN Dataset</head><p>Applied to the MAVEN dataset at 1 s orbital and magnetic field resolution, the corrector algorithm reaches an accuracy of ±0.02R p (±70 km) around the "true" shock (manually picked on a reduced dataset for comparison), a factor 4 increase in accuracy with respect to step 1. In the temporal datasets, this corresponds to only a few minutes of continuous data along MAVEN's orbit. This is epitomized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, which shows examples of shock crossing predictions from step 1 (dashed lines) in magnetic field data (left axis) as compared to the predictions from the predictor-corrector algorithm (unbroken lines, red for crossings into the magnetosheath, and blue for crossings into the solar wind). Right axes in green show ς mad,B and the associated threshold of 0.5, where ς mad,B &lt; 0.5 mainly occurs for upstream solar wind intervals. With the addition of criterion B th on the total magnetic field, only clear solar wind regions are captured by our algorithm, whereas ambiguous regions from the point of view of the magnetic field data are rejected.</p><p>At the beginning of the mission (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, December 2014), the automatic predictor algorithm gives a reliable estimate of this q ⊥ shock's position: this is expected since the prediction is based on the 3D quadric model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruesbeck et al. (2018)</ref> who specifically performed shock fits on the first years of the mission. In this case, the predictor-corrector algorithm only corrects the shock's estimated location by a few minutes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref> (September 2016) displays a case where the shock position is hard to ascertain from magnetic-field data only: the predictor estimate is off by up to 20 min for all crossings. Because of the constraints on the magnetic field amplitude and the lack of significant variations in |B| between 22:00 and 01:00 UT, the predictor-corrector algorithm ignores the two first expected crossings but corrects well for the two next crossings (around 03:30 and 04:45 UT). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref> shows a more complex mix between sheath and solar wind conditions, and even though the boundaries are more subtle and the overall B-field magnitude below 10 nT, the predictor-corrector algorithm manages to estimate the position of the q ‖ shock well, ignoring possibly unclear crossings which do not fulfill the combined threshold conditions on ς mad,B and B th (around 01:00 UT).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref> shows yet another example of the superiority of the predictor-corrector algorithm for some very clear bow shock crossings in 2020, after the orbit of MAVEN had been altered into a different orbit than at the beginning of the mission.</p><p>The final corrected timings for the detections yield with this algorithm a lower estimate of the total actual number of crossings encountered by a spacecraft throughout its mission. Events occurring when |B sw | 1/2 &gt; B th , even after shifting the temporal window significantly, or when ς mad,B &lt; ς th , were discarded in the final selection as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. They may indicate that the magnetic field was either too turbulent or too complex in its structure (e.g., multiple crossings as is regularly the case with q ‖ crossings) for the corrector algorithm to capture. Moreover, as discussed previously, the analytical approximation model used for the determination in step 1 (either 2D or 3D) is likely to underestimate the true number of crossings due to the planetary bow shock variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Halekas et al., 2017)</ref>. Because our study is primarily interested in the statistical position of the bow shock throughout the mission, this loss of potential detections may be compensated by the large number of orbits of the considered spacecraft.</p><p>For MAVEN, from the original 16,515 candidate detections from step 1 (predictor) using the 3D model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruesbeck et al. (2018)</ref> as a first approximation, our predictor-corrector algorithm selected 14,929 events (7,494 detections from the solar wind to the magnetosheath and 7,435 from the sheath to the solar wind) for the period 01 November 2014-07 February 2021. This is a 10% decrease in number of crossings, leaving out the less ambiguous events from the predictor algorithm. On average, the correction to the original timing is within about Δt ± 20 min along the spacecraft orbit, which corresponds to a percentage difference in radial distance of about ±25% (not shown). The calculated average difference |ΔR bs | over the entire dataset between predictor and predictor-corrector algorithm is ∼0.11R p , that is, ∼380 km or about 5% difference. The complete list of MAVEN crossings (times and spatial coordinates) derived with the predictor-corrector algorithm is compiled in Simon Wedlund et al. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>).</p><p>Out of these 14,929 crossings, we found that an overwhelming number (11,967) was predominantly q ⊥ crossings with θ Bn &gt; 45° as calculated with formula ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">19</ref>), the remaining 2,962 events being classified as more reminiscent of q ‖ shock conditions. It is important to recall that the method is biased toward clear signatures of q ⊥ -like bow shock crossings, in practice filtering out many q ‖ crossings, which may explain part of the discrepancy. About 22% of the q ⊥ crossings are highly perpendicular shocks (θ Bn ≥ 80°, 2,674 crossings), whereas only ∼1% of the q ‖ shocks are highly parallel ones (θ Bn ≤ 10°, 30 crossings). This is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, where the highest number of crossings occurs for θ Bn ∼ 80°. This is also in qualitative agreement with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vignes et al.

First we chose a focus location randomly between 0 and 1R p , and for each linear fit performed, the residuals are calculated. The adopted focus point is the one that minimizes the residuals. Because MAVEN's orbits are not suited to bow shock detections for Xʹ &lt; −0.5 R p , additional constraints on the tail distributions are necessary to obtain a more realistic conic fit. This can be achieved, for example, by using the predictions from a chosen pre-existing model for deeply negative Xʹ values, such as those of <ref type="bibr">Edberg et al. (2008, noted "</ref>E08" in the following) or <ref type="bibr">Hall et al. (2019, noted "H19")</ref> where bow shock detections were reported downstream to ′ min ≈ −1.5 p and to ≈ −5 p , respectively. First, additional "ghost" points (representing 10% of the total number of detections for the considered case) are calculated for ′ min &lt; ′ &lt; −0.5 p for the chosen model and randomized spatially around this result to give a more realistic tail spread. The linear regressions are then performed on the new constrained dataset. Tests were performed on the robustness of this method using different analytical models: E08 and H19 fits are essentially the same around the nose of the shock downstream to about −1 R p where patent differences start to appear. Because of the added cloud of ghost points, this is expected and thus 2D fits presented below are only valid in practice in the range [− 0.5 R p , R ss ]. Incidentally, differences on the terminator and subsolar standoff distances are less than 𝐴𝐴 𝐴2% in each case. It is noteworthy to add that the determination of the nature of the conic section found from the fits can be significantly altered when using tail models either from E08 (hyperbola) or from H19 (fits' nature given by these authors, ranging from ellipse to hyperbola, depend on the MY considered): in that case, the fit's nature will naturally be biased toward matching that of their respective parent tail model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4</head><p>Martian Bow Shock 3D Conic Parameters From Quadric Surface Fits Applied to the MAVEN Orbits and Magnetic Field Data (Predictor-Corrector Algorithm) Because of the spacecraft changing orbits during the mission, some of the ellipsoid fits appear anomalous in their orientation. This is especially obvious for MY35 when MAVEN, as of March 2020, decreased its apogee to ∼4,500 km and hence its revolution period to 3.5 hr to accommodate Mars 2020 rover operations on the ground. Consequently, MAVEN only seldom explored regions below X &lt; 0 R p for half of MY35: this makes it difficult to constrain the fit, and we end up with an ellipsoid having its longest principal axis unphysically tilted almost 90° in the X-Z plane (purple curves of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9a</ref>). A similar issue is found for Ls = 135°-225° (yellow, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9b</ref>), which has the lowest number of detections among Ls ranges and for which the orbit was never favorable for detections due to orbit precession. Thus, in these two cases, no physical interpretation should be drawn from the axes orientations of the ellipsoid and the fit should only be valid for near-subsolar crossings. More robust physics-based analytical models could be used to overcome these fitting issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kotova et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Discussion</head><p>Our 2D and 3D fits give some insight on how the Martian bow shock is moving globally for different conditions of MY, Ls, and EUV flux and complements previous studies with the MAVEN mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gruesbeck et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halekas et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Němec et al., 2020)</ref>. As the bow shock position is connected to the balance between thermal pressure from the plasma in the ionosphere and the dynamic pressure from the solar wind, any variation of these two quantities will have repercussions on the position of the shock.</p><p>When assuming axisymmetry around the aberrated axis X′ in the 2D polar rectangular coordinates case, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> and the average subsolar and terminator distances can be a first guide for our interpretation. Our new results with MAVEN (all points, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) agree rather well with past measurements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>) considering the data spread and estimated uncertainties: R ss = 1.74 ± 0.09 compared to 1.61 ± 0.08 R p and R td = 2.46 ± 0.13 compared to 2.56 ± 0.20 R p . More specifically, for:</p><p>1. Mars Years: The subsolar standoff distance decreases by as much as 10% between MY32 and MY33-MY34, from 1.87 to 1.69 R p , although some of this variation may be stemming from the relatively lower statistics for the first year (1,196 points for MY32 compared to &gt;4, 000 for all other years), due to the MAVEN mission starting toward the end of MY32. A similar tendency is seen for terminator standoff distances, with a 11% decrease seen between MY32 and MY35. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hall et al. (2019)</ref>, these variations may be connected through solar EUV irradiance to the solar cycle itself, when descending from the maximum of solar cycle 24 (encompassed by MY32) toward a minimum of activity (MY34) and the start of solar cycle 25 (MY35). A variation in R ss of similar magnitude (∼ 7% between minimum and maximum of activity) was shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hall et al. (2019)</ref> using MEX data for the previous solar cycles (23-24). 2. Seasonal variations: In contrast, the Ls ranges have a much more even statistics throughout, with more than 3,000 detections per season. Arguably, this makes comparing results between seasons statistically more significant than for the previous case. Overall, for northern spring equinox (Ls = [315°-45°]) and winter solstice (Ls = [225°-315°]) conditions, the bow shock appears to expand in the subsolar direction by about 7%-13% from its summer and autumn position (R ss ≥ 1.72 R p compared to R ss ≈ 1.61 R p ). Simultaneously, the area encompassed by the bow shock conic is also increased during those two instances. One possible driving factor behind these changes may be in turn linked to changes in Mars' dayside upper atmosphere and extended exosphere, and how they expand and contract with seasons, increasing or decreasing the size of the obstacle to the solar wind flow <ref type="bibr">(Hall et al., 2016 and references therein)</ref>. A denser lower atmosphere around perihelion (Ls° ∼ 251° where the EUV flux is highest on average) and during the dust storm season in the autumn <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Trainer et al., 2019)</ref> may drive the ionosphere to expand significantly at constant EUV flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dubinin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sánchez-Cano et al., 2016)</ref>, offering a more efficient obstacle to the solar wind. Similarly the expansion of Mars' extended exosphere (notably modulated by the solar wind flux) increases the efficiency of the solar wind charge-exchange process (with a net conversion of fast solar wind ions to slow-moving heavy ions of planetary origin, effectively slowing down the solar wind, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Edberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halekas et al., 2017)</ref>. Both aspects result in the standoff distance moving outwards. The opposite effect is expected when upper atmosphere densities are lower in the deep summer and in the beginning of the autumn and the bow shock surface shrinks. The fits and characteristics of the shock appear consistent with this picture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EUV flux variations:</head><p>The effect of a relatively larger flux on the shock position is twofold, globally increasing the ionization rates in the ionosphere and through photoionization of the extended exosphere as well as heating up and expanding the neutral atmosphere-exosphere system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Edberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Forbes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall et al., 2016)</ref>. Photoionization of exospheric neutrals creates newly born ions that are picked up by the solar wind convective electric field, resulting in mass-loading and slowing down of the solar wind flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Yamauchi et al., 2015</ref>, with the presence of pickup ions in the foreshock region). Such combined effects have been shown to expand the bow shock in the solar wind direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mazelle et al., 2004)</ref>. The two fits we present here, one for higher and one for lower EUV fluxes (more than 6,500 points each), display the expected behavior, with a larger standoff distance by 7% and a noticeably larger flaring of the fitted conic for the higher EUV fluxes (terminator distances increasing from 2.41 to 2.54 R p , i.e., 5%). 4. Shock conditions: q ‖ and q ⊥ bow shock crossings are related to the average interplanetary magnetic field's (IMF) direction and the spacecraft's orbit (more precisely, the spherical quadrant in which the spacecraft emerges into the solar wind). Because the predictor-corrector algorithm favors q ⊥ detections (Section 3.2), the statistics between the two cases is heavily unbalanced (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vignes et al., 2002</ref>, for a similar result). On average, we find no significant difference between the two conditions, with the shock surface slightly contracting and flaring up in q ⊥ conditions with respect to q ‖ conditions (|ΔR ss,td | ∼4%). Such a tendency is marginal considering that these percentages are at the precision limit obtained with the fits.</p><p>Let us now look at our 3D fit results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> clearly shows several asymmetries depending on the MY, Ls, EUV flux' and shock condition. The usual pronounced North-South asymmetry (X MSO − Z MSO plane, second column, and also Y MSO − Z MSO plane, third column), mostly ascribed to the presence of crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gruesbeck et al., 2018)</ref>, is clearly seen for all cases with the standoff subsolar distances being skewed toward that hemisphere. This is shown by crosses representing the tip of the projected ellipsoid (calculated by the formulae in Appendix B) located all in the fourth quadrant in the X MSO − Z MSO plane. A similar tendency is sometimes marginally observed in the X MSO − Y MSO plane (first column), when the shock surface is skewed toward the dawn hemisphere (−Y MSO ), with standoff subsolar distances on average larger than on the dusk hemisphere. This is true for MY32 and MY33 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9a</ref>) and for larger EUV fluxes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9c</ref>). For lower EUV fluxes (and, incidentally, all other cases), the opposite seems to be taking place with the position of the maximum standoff distance being in the dusk +Y MSO hemisphere. It is difficult at this stage to tell if these latter (small) effects may stem mainly or not from the dawn-dusk asymmetry of the atmosphere and hence of the ionosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gupta et al., 2019)</ref>. Likewise, as in the 2D case, it is important to note that many drivers of the shock position (EUV flux, atmospheric seasons, etc.) all act in combination at any given time: our fits do not discriminate precisely between these effects. A finer characterization of each driver separately is left for another study.</p><p>A comparison between all standoff distances, subsolar and terminator alike, and calculated by our 2D and 3D algorithms is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>, and based on Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">3 and 4</ref>. The standoff distances calculated from the 3D fits show the same tendencies as their 2D counterparts, although since the X and Y coordinates are not solar-wind aberrated and hence no axisymmetry is considered, the comparison between the 2D and 3D cases can only be that of general trends. From MY32 to MY35, a general decrease of standoff distances can be seen. Excluding R td,y , the other standoff distances first steadily decrease from Ls centered on 0° (labeled "Ls1") to 180° ("Ls3") but then increase significantly toward Ls values around 270° ("Ls4"), which may be linked to the EUV flux becoming maximum at perihelion Ls = 251°. This result is arguably in contrast to those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vignes et al. (2002)</ref> although our statistics with MAVEN is much larger than in their study. In an identical way to the 2D fits, larger EUV fluxes result in a bow shock surface significantly expanding in the solar wind toward the subsolar direction.</p><p>With respect to the geometry of the shock, the subsolar standoff distances R ss appear to marginally increase from q ⊥ to q ‖ conditions, although the inverse trend is seen for the terminator distances. Again, these differences are slight, which may reflect in part the bias against q ‖ conditions of our bow shock estimator (thus yielding a low amount of q ‖ shock detections).</p><p>As a preliminary conclusion, we note that:</p><p>1. The X MSO − Y MSO and X MSO − Z MSO asymmetry seems particularly marked for Ls = [135°-225°] (labeled "Ls3" on the figure), MY32, MY35, and higher EUV fluxes: it can readily be seen by comparing the length of the blue and red bars. As explained earlier, the number of points used for fits for MY32 is the lowest of all the cases because MAVEN arrived at Mars late in MY32. This is in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruesbeck et al. (2018)</ref>. On average and outside of those special cases, the shock's shape stays rather symmetric about the X MSO axis: the terminator distances R td,z (3D fits) and R td (2D fits) indeed seem to match rather well most of the time. This axisymmetric tendency can be further amplified by aligning the X MSO − Y MSO plane with the solar wind aberration system, rotating the 3D quadric surface 4° anticlockwise around the Z MSO axis; new standoff distances for the 3D fits (R td,z and R ss ) differ by less than 5% with their corresponding 2D fits values (not shown). 2. Although the 3D and 2D conic fits retain strong similarities in their behavior, the 3D fits (seemingly paradoxically) appear more robust and less affected by external assumptions. It is recalled here that not only do the 2D fits assume axisymmetry around 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴 ′ MSO , but certain 2D fits had to also be constrained at larger Euclidean distances from the center of the planet due to the poor coverage of MAVEN for ′ MSO ≲ 0.5 p . This superiority of the 3D fitting algorithm is due to: (a) the number of fitting variables (A to I, allowing more flexibility despite risking over-determination of the linear system of equations), (b) the natural asymmetry of the shock (however small), and (c) the fitting points being statistically better distributed over a larger space (both in X MSO − Y MSO and X MSO − Z MSO planes instead of a single polar plane) and thus optimizing the fits. 3. Because the Martian seasons (monitored by Ls ranges) to a degree and the EUV flux both depend on Mars' heliocentric distance, correlations between these fits are to be expected. For example, similar fits for low Ls values (&lt;135 • ) and low EUV flux can be seen in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8c and 8e</ref> (orange curves) and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9b</ref> and 9c (red curves).</p><p>4. Because the solar cycle is a continuous underlying driver of the shock's position regardless of the binnings adopted here <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hall et al., 2019)</ref>, we expect also correlations between EUV flux and Mars year results. This effect is most clearly exemplified with the shock standoff decrease when going from the declining phase of solar cycle 24 (MY32 and MY33, high fluxes) to the next solar minimum (MY34, low fluxes)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this study, we presented a fast method to estimate automatically the position of the bow shock in real spacecraft orbits, as well as analytical expressions for the normal direction to the shock surface at any point in its close vicinity. After a survey of existing analytical smooth models of the bow shock surface at the planet based on 2D and 3D fits, we used these models as a first prediction of the shock position in the data and refined this prediction further with a predictor-corrector algorithm based on the median absolute deviation of the magnetic field around the predicted shock. This method, biased toward the detection of q ⊥ shocks but not entirely limited to them, does not substitute for a detailed analysis of the crossing or for machine-learning techniques currently developed for space missions. It however finds a useful application when it is necessary to quickly determine the position of the spacecraft, or at least an estimate thereof, with respect to the bow shock.</p><p>As part of the solar wind and space weather database Helio4Cast, our technique was successfully used to retrieve solar wind undisturbed parameters from the MAVEN mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Möstl et al., 2020)</ref>. We also successfully applied the predictor-corrector method to the MAVEN orbit and magnetic field data between November 2014 and February 2021 (see list compiled by Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wedlund et al., 2021)</ref>, and performed a series of fits, in 2D and in 3D, to test our method and investigate statistically the shape of the shock depending on MY, solar longitude Ls, and two solar EUV flux levels. The 3D fitting has obvious advantages over the 2D polar axisymmetric geometry usually used to describe the shock structure, namely, a more accurate estimate of asymmetries in the global structure, and taking full advantage of the 3D distribution of bow shock detections in space. This is especially important for bodies such as Mars with large orbital eccentricities and axial tilts to the ecliptic, and for which the heliocentric distance is a strong driver of the EUV flux input and seasonal changes on the planet.</p><p>Expectedly, we found the Martian shock to be highly asymmetric with respect to the North-South hemispheres, in agreement with previous studies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruesbeck et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halekas et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hall et al., 2016)</ref>. Such an asymmetry is in part linked to the presence of crustal magnetic fields at Mars; a specific study taking into account the planet's rotation and the location of these crustal magnetic sources on the nightside or on the dayside is left for the future. Bow shock fits for quasi-perpendicular and parallel shock conditions were, to the precision of our approach, almost identical. In addition, the shock appeared noticeably asymmetric with respect to Y MSO and Z MSO directions in specific conditions, namely, for MY32 and MY35, Ls = [135°-225°] and larger EUV fluxes. Despite this observed asymmetry, solar-aberrated axisymmetric models may still provide a worthy first approximation of the shock's shape and position.</p><p>To investigate further the conditions of the shock's asymmetry throughout different solar cycles, solar drivers, and internal drivers, such as crustal magnetic fields, and isolate their respective contribution, a full exploitation of MAVEN's continuously growing datasets is warranted; likewise, a reanalysis of past encounters at Mars using 3D quadric fits would be a welcome addition. These are left for future studies. Applications of these methods, especially in 3D, to other bodies with large orbital eccentricities (such as Mercury) may also prove of interest.

(d) 28 March 2020, with five crossings all oblique toward q ⊥ conditions, with θ Bn ≈ 45°, 49°, 80°, 82°, and 88°, successively. The predictor geometric detections (Section 3.1) are in dashed lines and labeled "automatic," whereas the predictorcorrector detections proposed in Section 3.2 are in solid lines. Highlighted in different colors are crossings from solar wind to magnetosheath (labeled SW → MS, red) and from magnetosheath to solar wind (labeled MS → SW, blue). Calculations of θ Bn angles were performed using median averages of B over the color-highlighted regions (blue for MS → SW crossings, red for SW → MS crossings). The threshold ς th = 0.5 is shown as a horizontal dashed line (right y-axis, green).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: Characteristics of a Quadric Surface</head><p>The 3D planetary bow shock in this paper is approximated as a quadratic surface described by a Cartesian equation (Equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>). Mathematically, 17 different quadrics can exist. However, here only three are physically acceptable for the approximation of a bow shock surface. These are the "real" ellipsoid, the elliptic paraboloid, and the hyperboloid of two sheets. From coefficients A to I defining the quadric's surface equation, it is possible to extract more "physical" quantities from these surfaces, such as the center of the surface, the direction of the principal axes, the typical length, or the "nose" of the surface. This requires the analysis of one particular matrix M given by:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Subsolar Tip of the Trace of an Ellipsoid Surface in Cartesian Coordinates</head><p>The subsolar point of the projection of a 3D ellipsoid in 2D planes, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> (crosses), can be obtained by finding the roots of the corresponding 2D conic in the plane considered. For z = 0, Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) becomes a second order equation:</p><p>Fixing variable y, the equation can be put in quadratic form with the following positive root:</p><p>Finding the maximum of this function is equivalent to finding a y value that maximizes this function. Posing ξ = Dy + G, its derivative has the form:</p><p>Solving 𝐴𝐴 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 M 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 0 for y and using that result in Equation (B2) makes it possible to calculate the final (x, y) coordinates of the projected ellipsoid's tip in the corresponding x − y plane. An identical reasoning can be made for the x − z plane. This tip in a plane is however not necessarily the farthest subsolar point of the ellipsoid's surface. Its position in 3D is by contrast given by Equation (A2) in Appendix A.</p></div>
