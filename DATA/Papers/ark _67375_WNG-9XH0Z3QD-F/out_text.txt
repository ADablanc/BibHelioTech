[1] The Cluster satellites crossed the Earth’s bow shock several times on 31 March 2001.
For all these crossings the bow shock was supercritical and quasi-perpendicular. We
present here the results of a detailed analysis of the magnetic field fluctuations observed
downstream of the shock. We use data from the four Cluster spacecraft to determine the
behavior and the geometry of these fluctuations with good accuracy. Shortly after the ramp
crossing, we observed a large-amplitude nonlinear Alfvén wave, propagating along the
downstream average magnetic field with a spectrum peaking at two frequencies below the
proton and the alpha ion cyclotron frequencies. Farther downstream in the magnetosheath
the magnetic field fluctuations took the form of three-dimensional structures which can
be interpreted as cylindrical field-aligned current tubes. It is the first time that such current
tubes have been observed downstream of a quasi-perpendicular shock, and they are
closely associated with a quasi-monochromatic, finite amplitude Alfvén wave. We suggest
that a close relation exists between the nonlinear Alfvén wave and the current tubes as a
result of a filamentation instability which is expected to occur at 8 > 1 and for frequencies

comparable to the ion cyclotron frequencies.

1. Introduction

[2] The structure of supercritical, quasi-perpendicular
collisionless shocks is largely controlled by gyrating ions
reflected at the shock ramp [see, e.g., Leroy et al., 1982;
Paschmann et al., 1982]. Once they move downstream of
the shock ramp, these ions contribute to the temperature
anisotropy 7;, > Tj, where 7;, and 7; are the ion
temperatures perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to an
ambient magnetic field. This anisotropy is then the source
of Alfvén ion cyclotron and/or mirror instabilities [see

Schwartz et al., 1996]. When the proton thermal energy
density is small with respect to the magnetic energy density,
3, < 1, the most unstable mode is the Alfvén ion cyclotron
mode (AIC), while the mirror mode is the most unstable one
in the opposite situation. Furthermore, with a sufficient
proportion of anisotropic a particles both the proton
cyclotron and the heltum cyclotron modes are destabilized
[Gary et al., 1994].

[3] The nonlinear evolution of the AIC instability is not
yet fully understood. Several saturation mechanisms may
operate, either the quasi-linear relaxation [see, e.g., Yoon,
1992] or stronger nonlinearities like the parametric or
modulational instabilities. In particular, if there is a perturbation with a finite component of the wave vector orthogonal to the ambient magnetic field B, k, 4 0, the Alfvén
wave may be unstable to a transverse instability, which
generates field-aligned magnetic tubes, where the local
concentration of the transverse magnetic energy increases.
This phenomenon, called the filamentation instability, has
been observed in Hall-MHD simulations for the parallelpropagating circularly polarized Alfvén wave pumps
[Laveder et al., 2002].

[4] In this study we present Cluster observations suggesting that the filamentation instability may play a role

in the saturation of the AIC instability and in the
temperature anisotropy relaxation downstream of quasiperpendicular shocks. These observations were obtained
in the region immediately downstream of a supercritical,
quasi-perpendicular bow shock where the plasma parameters were suitable for the development of the AIC
instability: 8,, < 1 and simultaneously anisotropic protons
and a particles. AIC waves were effectively observed
downstream but close to the shock front with a relatively
narrow spectrum centered on two frequencies comparable
to the proton and «a particle gyrofrequencies (see section 3);
their steepened waveform displays evidence of significant
nonlinearities.

[5] The most important result of this work is the identification, farther downstream, of field-aligned current tubes
(section 4). Similar current tubes were already observed by
the ISEE spacecraft [Rezeau et al., 1993] in the magnetopause boundary layer, while the present observations were
made in the region downstream of the bow shock, just after
crossing a region where a large-amplitude AIC wave was
observed. We suggest that the current tubes, which look like
the magnetic filaments (D. Laveder, private communication,
2003), result from the filamentation instability of the AIC
wave.

2. Observations

[6] On 31 March 2001 the four Cluster spacecraft came
out of the magnetosphere at ~1440 UT and crossed the bow
shock for the first time at ~1710 UT, the GSE coordinates
of the magnetopause and bow shock crossings being (6.6,
0.2, 8.8)R- and (9.4, —1.4, 9.1)Re, respectively. After this
crossing, nine successive shock crossings were observed
until 2000 UT. All these shocks were quasi-perpendicular,
the angle Og, between the normal to the shock and the
magnetic field ranging between 60° and 90° [Maksimovic et
al., 2003].

[7] We have analyzed the magnetic field waveforms
obtained by the search coils of the Spatio-Temporal
Analysis of Field Fluctuations (STAFF) experiment
[Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al., 1997, 2003] at a sampling

ALEXANDROVA ET AL.: ALFVEN WAVES AND FIELD-ALIGNED FILAMENTS

frequency of 25 Hz. Since these waveforms have been
high-pass filtered to remove the spacecraft spin modulation, we have also used the data from the fluxgate
magnetometer (FGM) experiment at 4-s resolution
[Balogh et al., 2001] to recover the low frequencies.
Both signals are combined by using a Haar wavelet
transform (see Appendix A for more details) to retain
the slow trends given by the smoothed FGM data as well
as the fast variations of the STAFF magnetic waveforms.
The “mixed” waveforms, which will be used throughout
this study, are then obtained by inverting the resulting
wavelet transform. We shall also use the potential of Haar
wavelet transform to detect fast variations of the fields
because of its good time resolution.

[s] In this paper, we shall examine in more detail an
outward crossing at 1802:17 UT. A first estimate of the
shock normal in the GSE system was obtained by using the
time delays between the shock crossings by the four
spacecraft [Schwartz, 1998; Maksimovic et al., 2003]. This
ylelds a normal ny, = (0.94, —0.26, 0.21) approximately
parallel to the Sun-Earth direction. The relative positions of
the four spacecraft at the time of the shock crossing, the
downstream magnetic field, and the plane of the shock front
with its normal are illustrated in Figure 1.

[9] The GSE direction of maximum magnetic field
variance during the interval 1800—1804 UT around the
shock crossing is b = (0.23, —0.13, —0.96); the direction
varies very little between the four spacecraft. The maximum variance direction is expected to be orthogonal to
the shock normal according to the coplanarity theorem.
Thus we have chosen the unit vector parallel to —b x
(b x n,.) as the actual shock normal, n = (0.93, —0.26, 0.26)
~ n,. We shall use the direct shock coordinate system
(n, b x n, b) = (n, m, @) based on this “improved” shock
normal.

[10] The magnetosheath and solar wind plasma parameters obtained by the Cluster 1 (C,) and ACE spacecraft for
this crossing are given in Table 1. ACE data are taken with a
30-min delay corresponding to the solar wind travel time
from the ACE location to the Earth orbit.

[11] The upstream and downstream average magnetic
fields B,,, and B,,,;, have been determined as averages over
the two time intervals 1802:55—1804:07 UT upstream, and
1800:31—1801:43 UT downstream, respectively. They both
have strong southward components in the GSE coordinate
system; in the shock frame their components are By, =
(—2.4, 3.4, 29.5) and Bysy = (—2.3, 3.5, 88.1) nT, which
shows that the normal component of the magnetic field is
approximately constant across the shock and that the
coplanarity theorem applies reasonably well.

[12] The velocity data are obtained from the Cluster Ion
Spectrometry (CIS) experiment [Reme et al., 1997] in the
magnetosheath and from the ACE/Solar Wind Electron
Proton Alpha Monitor [McComas et al., 1998] in the
solar wind since CIS was in an operating mode that
allowed good measurements only in the magnetosheath
without ion separation. The bulk speeds are given in the
rest frame of the shock, which moves with a local
speed ~12 km/s toward the Earth in the GSE system
[Maksimovic et al., 2003]. The proton temperature 7, is
also taken from CIS downstream and from ACE
upstream. The electron temperature 7, 1s measured by

speeds are given in the rest frame of the shock.

the Plasma Electron and Current Experiment (PEACE)
instrument [Johnstone et al., 1997].

[13] The electron concentration N, in the solar wind can
be reliably estimated by the location of the plasma line by
the Waves of High Frequency and Sounder for Probing of
Elecron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) radio receiver
[Décréau et al., 1997]. In the magnetosheath the plasma
line, even if not easily distinguishable from the noise
level, gives an electron density of around 60 cm~”. As
noted above, the CIS instrument was in the magnetospheric mode for this particular shock crossing, and the
CIS composition and distribution function (CODIF) sensor (with ion separation) was saturated because the proton
concentration exceeded 5—10 cm °. Therefore in the
solar wind we use ACE data to determine the «a particle
abundance N,/N, ~ 0.11 and the quasi-neutrality to obtain
the a and proton densities N, and N,,. In the magnetosheath the CIS hot ion analyzer (HIA) sensor (without ion
separation) gives a total ion concentration of ~40 cm’,
This density does not satisfy a mass flux conservation
across the bow shock; assuming a downstream abundance
N./N, equal to the upstream one, the mass flux conservation gives N. = 56 cm ° downstream. Therefore throughout this paper we will use the WHISPER result that is
closer to this theoretical value and not the CIS density.
Other parameters such as the Alfvén velocities Vy, =
B/,/\oP (p is the total mass density), the 1on inertial lengths
c/w,;, and the proton and electron betas 3,, and 8, are also
presented in Table 1. In particular, the Alfvén Mach
number of the shock is My = V,/V, = 4.4 (V, 1s the
upstream normal velocity in the shock rest frame), and
the angle between the interplanetary magnetic field and
the shock normal is Og, = 82°; therefore the shock is
supercritical and quasi-perpendicular.

3. The AIC Waves

[14] Figure 2 displays the time profile of the three
components of the magnetic field (in the shock frame)
and of the proton temperature anisotropy T,,\/T,)
observed by the C, spacecraft for a 12-min interval around
the time of shock crossing at 1802:17 UT, taken as the
origin of time for Figure 2 and most of the following
analysis. An almost monochromatic wave can be observed

in the n and m components of the magnetic field for ~300 s
downstream of the shock crossing. This is most clearly
illustrated by using the Morlet wavelet transform (see
Appendix A). The wavelet amplitudes WB, f, t) give the
contribution at time ¢ of fluctuations at scale 1/fto the total
fluctuation 68,(7) of the jth component of the magnetic field.
Figure 3 shows the contour levels in the timescale plane
of the squared amplitude of the wavelet coefficients
\WB,( f, t)|” of the n component of the magnetic field for
the same time period as Figure 2 (here also t = 0 at the shock
crossing time). The scales (1/f) range from 0.1 to 18.0 s,
and the amplitude levels are represented by a color scale
ranging from black (low) to red (high). The proton
cyclotron period 1/f,,(s) is shown by a solid line in Figure 3.

[1s] One can see in Figure 3 the intense structured
emission just before the shock crossing, corresponding
to the quasi-sinusoidal wave seen in Figure 2. It lasts for
~4 min, from 280 s before the shock crossing to 30 s
before the shock crossing, and peaks at 3—5 s scales.
Deeper in the magnetosheath, at about —350 s, the
fluctuation regime changes (see the vertical dashed line),
and we observe intermittent peaks of energy, identified by
black arrows, at scales between 1 and 2 s, which will be
discussed in section 4.

[16] Simultaneous with the intense narrowband emission seen on the scalogram of Figure 3, a relatively large
proton temperature anisotropy is observed (see the fourth
panel of Figure 2). This anisotropy has a peak value just
downstream of the shock ramp and reaches a more or
less constant value of ~1.7 deeper in the magnetosheath,
when the field loses its quasi-sinusoidal character. It can
therefore be expected that the observed wave is an AIC
wave resulting from the development of an instability due
to the particle anisotropies.

3.1. Linear Theory

[17] A linear analysis based on Vlasov theory, using an
improved version of the linear dispersion code called
WHAMP developed by Ronnmark [1982, 1983], confirms
indeed that the level of anisotropy observed just downstream of the shock can be indicative of an AIC instability. For this, we have assumed bi-Maxwellian electron,
proton, and «a particle distribution functions, with parameters as close as possible to the observed values.

[18] In particular, the parallel electron and proton temperatures and the corresponding temperature anisotropies are
taken as 7. = 85 eV, 7. /T.) = 1.1 (as observed by PEACE)
and 7, ~ 170 eV, T/T, = 2.5 (as observed by CIS),
respectively. The « particle anisotropy is assumed to be the
same as that of the protons, and the particle temperature is
taken to be 7, ~ 47), a reasonable value downstream of a
quasi-perpendicular bow shock with an upstream temperature ratio (14\\/T\)sw = 4 [Zhao et al., 1991; Fuselier et al.,
1991]. The other parameters (magnetic field magnitude and
concentrations) are taken from Table 1.

[19] With these parameters the most unstable modes are
Alfvén waves propagating along the background magnetic
field. The corresponding linear growth rate (Figure 4a)
and frequency (Figure 4b) are displayed as functions of
the normalized wave vector fr, parallel to the magnetic
field, r, being the proton Larmor radius based on the

direction.

3.2. Properties of the Narrowband Waves

[21] We shall now show that the narrowband waves
observed in the period 4 min prior to the shock crossing
are indeed the expected AIC waves.

[22] First, a minimum variance analysis of the magnetic
field [Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998] performed during a
relatively uniform period from 260 to 170 s before the shock
crossing for the satellite C, indicates that the direction of
minimum variance, estimated to be parallel to the wave
vector direction @yin = (—0.19, 0.07, 0.98) in the shock (n,
m, 1) frame, is approximately parallel to the ambient magnetic field B,,,,,. The polarization of 5B in the (n, m) plane is
circular and left-handed with respect to B,,,,, as shown in
Figure 5a. Therefore the polarization and propagation direction is compatible with that expected for an Alfvén wave
propagating along the ambient magnetic field. The same
results were obtained for the other three spacecraft.

[23] Second, a Fourier transform of the magnetic waveforms in the same uniform period (Figure 5b) shows that two
frequencies are excited in the spacecraft frame: f, = 0.29 Hz
and f2 = 0.57 Hz. There is approximately a factor of 2 between

ALEXANDROVA ET AL.: ALFVEN WAVES AND FIELD-ALIGNED FILAMENTS

A05207

f, and fo, indicating by comparison with Figure 4 that both the
a particle and proton anisotropies contribute to the instability.
Note that the spectral peak at the lower frequency /; 1s larger
than the one at f>, as predicted by the linear Vlasov theory,
and dominates the waveform visible in Figure 2.

[24] In order to obtain the frequencies in the plasma rest
frame, fo,; and fo, the Doppler effect should be taken into
account:

w = Juv + (k - V5] (1)

where w = 27f is the observed frequency in the satellite
frame (assumed to be at rest in the GSE frame of reference),
V, = 270(—0.95, 0.11, 0.29) km/s is the magnetosheath
plasma bulk velocity in the GSE frame for the wave
observation period, and k is the still unknown wave vector.

[25] The wave vector can be determined by using data
from the four Cluster spacecraft [Balikhin et al., 1997,
2000; Sahraoui et al., 2003]. Indeed, let us make a Fourier
transform of one component of the magnetic field, say,
Bx{t, i), where i denotes the spacecraft. At a given frequency
jf the Fourier amplitude By( f, i) is a complex number with a

phase y,;(f). Taking C, as the reference spacecraft, the
phase difference between the magnetic waveforms observed
on C5, C3, and C, and that observed on C, can be written as

lpi (f) a v(t) — (k ori;) +20m;, i= 2,3,4, (2)
where or}; =r, — r; 1s the separation vector between C, and
C;. This is a system of three equations for the three
components of the wave vector, which depends on unknown
parameter 1,; = 0, +1, .... This indeterminacy can be lifted
by imposing some requirements: (1) The solution must be
parallel to the direction of minimum variance e,,;,; (2) the
angle between the magnetic field and k is expected to be
small, as predicted by the linear theory; (3) the function
ile ft) — pdf] — (k + ori) — 2nn,;}~ must be
minimal; and (4) we choose the smallest 1,;; compatible with
the first three requirements. In this way we obtain (in the
GSE system of coordinates)

k, = 14 x 10°°(0.27, —0.26, —0.93) km™!
for the wave observed at frequency /; = 0.29 Hz, and
ky = 25 x 10°-°(—0.07, —0.23, —0.97) km™!

for the wave observed at frequency f, = 0.57 Hz. In the (n,
m, /) frame the unit vectors of k, and k> are

ex = (0.08,0.12,0.99) er = (—0.25, 0.18, 0.95).

These wave vectors are approximatively parallel to the
ambient magnetic field: The angle between e,,, and B,,,.;, 1S
~10°; for the second mode this angle is ~15°.

[26] Using equation (1), we can now determine the wave
frequencies in the plasma rest frame:

0,1 = 0.62 Hz fo2 = 0.83 Hz

and the corresponding parallel phase velocities V., = wo/ky.
For the first wave mode we find V., ~ 280 km/s; for the
second mode we find V.,, ~ 215 km/s. These values are
compatible, within the observational uncertainties, with the
estimated Alfvén speed in the magnetosheath (see Table 1).

[27] Furthermore, there is a qualitative agreement with
the predictions of the linear Vlasov theory. The two
solutions we found, ky), = 0.31 and Agr, = 0.55, fo =
0.43f-p and for = 0.58f.p, are in a good agreement with the
nonlinear dispersion relation presented in Figure 4b.
However, they do not correspond exactly to the maxima
of the growth rate. A better quantitative agreement could be
achieved by changing the parameters used in the linear
theory; however, as discussed in section 2, some of these
parameters are so uncertain that the qualitative agreement
achieved here is the only one which is meaningful.

[28] Therefore the polarization, the dispersive properties
of the waves, and the comparison with the linear theory
confirm the identification of the observed wave modes at /;
and f, as Alfvén ion cyclotron waves excited by the
anisotropy of the a particles and the protons, respectively.

[29] The waveforms of the AIC are periodic, but a detailed
analysis reveals that they are not sinusoidal and have steepened wave fronts, indicating the presence of relatively
strong nonlinearities. This is apparent in Figure 6, which

displays the profile of the magnetic field component B,, for
the period from 260 to 170 s before the shock crossing.

[30] A more systematic analysis can be made by using the
Haar wavelet transform (see Appendix A), which we shall
apply to this period when the AIC waves have a relatively
uniform behavior. A local gradient will be qualified as steep
when the local energy at the smallest scale (1.e., the square
of the wavelet coefficient calculated on At = 0.08 s) exceeds
by some threshold value yn > 1 the mean energy of the
fluctuations at this scale: |WBy|* > (WB), the average
(WB) being taken on the whole interval of analysis. Note
that the result of the analysis does not depend on the
particular value of 1 as soon as it is larger than 3—5.

[31] Then a minimum variance analysis of the magnetic
field fluctuations over a time interval of 2 s is made around
each time when a “‘steep”’ gradient is detected. The number
of points with a steep gradient obviously depends on the
value of 7, but in most cases only one component of the
magnetic field has a large variation, while the other two
remain almost constant. The component of maximal variance is always orthogonal to the large-scale magnetic field
Busy. This is illustrated in Figure 7, which displays the
profiles of the three components of 6B in the local minimum
variance frame for an interval of At = 2 s around the
“singularity”’ (a time with a steep gradient) occurring at
tsing ~ —220 s (1758:38 UT). Here the directions of
maximum, intermediate, and minimum variance are x’, y,
and z’, respectively. One can see that 6B, changes sign at
tsing and that the other two components fluctuate around
zero. The eigenvalues of the variance tensor [Sonnerup and
Scheible, 1998] are 1, 0.33, and 0.03, respectively, the
direction of minimum variance making an angle of ~15°
with B,,s,. Therefore these “‘singularities”’ are current sheets
approximately parallel to the wave fronts, presumably
produced by some nonlinear steepening of the AIC waves.

deep in the magnetosheath, 1.e., before —350 s. However,
during the time interval from 500 to 350 s before the shock
crossing, the level of magnetic field turbulence remains
relatively high, with strong localized peaks, marked by the
arrows, at scales between | and 2 s. One may consider these
peaks as “singular” points, 1.e., times at which a steep
gradient is observed, as discussed in section 3.2. The time
width of these localized peaks is significantly bigger than
the sampling time, so to identify the singular points in this
region, the time resolution of the Morlet wavelet transform
(WT) is sufficient, and we do not need the high time
resolution of the Haar WT (see Appendix A). Here also,
the number of singular points depends on the threshold »,
but above a minimal value they all share the same properties, which are significantly different from the planar current
sheets discussed in section 3.2.

[33] Let us consider one of these singularities occurring at
tT ~ —420 s (1755:16 UT). During a 10-s period around T,
C, observes a regular magnetic field profile as illustrated by
the component 6B, in Figure 8a, where x’ is the maximum
variance direction in the local variance frame, calculated
over the period under consideration. The variance analysis
of 6B for this period gives the three eigenvalues 1, 0.68, and
0.14, so the singularity has a higher dimension than the
current sheets. In Figure 8b the three components (6B,,
6B,, 6B.) of 6B in the same minimum variance frame are
displayed for the 2-s interval around Tt (the period between
the two vertical dotted lines in Figure 8a). One can see that
SB has a three-dimensional (3-D) structure: None of the
components remains constant, contrary to the case of the
current sheets, even if the fluctuation in 6B, is smaller than
that of the two other components. The direction of minimum variance is approximately parallel to B,,,,,, indicating
that the axis of the symmetry of the 3-D structure is field
aligned.

[34] As seen in Figure 1, the separation vector (in GSE)
or)4 = (46.0, —23.6, 654.3) km between C, and C, is almost
parallel to B,,.;,. The angle between these two vectors is 19°.

If the structures observed by C, are field aligned, it is
expected that they will be found in the C, data. Indeed, a
good correlation between the field variations observed on
C, and Cy, are found for the singularities occurring around
King = 1755:10 and (ine = 1755:11, respectively:

C(8Bo!, &BS) = 0.98,
C (8B! 8B) = 0.78, (3)
C (8B, 8BS) = 0.27

Figure 9 presents the time profile of 5B measured by C,
(solid line) and C4 (dashed line) for the 2-s periods around
fing and fine in the local minimum variance frame of C.
The small jumps in the C,; data (~4 nT) are due to the
STAFF search coil (SC) calibration method.

[35] The correlations in equation (3) indicate that it is
highly probable that C, and C, observe the same structure.
Thus its parallel dimension should be greater than the C,C4 separation 614 = 620 km parallel to B,,s,. In Figure 10

1.4.s and the separation 6R | ;4 ~ 200 km can then be used to
determine the displacement velocity of the structure V, ~
140 km/s in the plane perpendicular to B,,,,;,. This velocity is
calculated assuming that the structure is exactly parallel to
the ambient magnetic field, but the angle of 10° between
B,ns, and the axis of the structure (an average value over the
several structures) can change this result from 70 to 230 km/s.
This last value is very close to the plasma bulk velocity.

[36] A similar profile of magnetic field variation can be
obtained with a very simple two-dimensional model, where
a cylindrical current tube of radius Ro is flowing along an
ambient magnetic field B = Be,. Assuming that all the
spatial dependencies are in the (x, y) plane, the model is
characterized by two functions, 58,(x, y) and the z component A(x, y) of the potential vector A = Ae, of the magnetic
fluctuation, which we take as Gaussian so that

where AB) and AB, characterize the parallel and perpendicular amplitude, respectively, of the magnetic fluctuations
(R is the distance to the tube axis, R? =x? + y*). Since 6B =
6B.e. + V x A, 5B, = (—2y/Ro) A and 8B, = (2x/Ro)A. The
source of this magnetic perturbation is a field-aligned
localized current tube given by the Maxwell equation V x

This current has a maximal longitudinal current at the center
of the tube and maximal transversal current at the tube
border.

[37] An instrument carried by a spacecraft crossing the
structure in the (x, y) plane along a trajectory p(t) = po + Vat
with a velocity Vx (po is the spacecraft position at time ft =
0) would measure a magnetic field fluctuation {6B,[p(0],
OB, [p()], oB.[p(H]} which is qualitatively similar to the
observed one once the parameters are correctly adjusted. In
particular, using Ro = 60 km, AB) ~ 15 nT, AB, /AB) ~ 2,
and the distance of closest approach to the tube axis 30 km,
we obtain the profiles of 6B,, 65,, and 6B, shown in
Figure 8c. This model is oversimplified and does not rely on
a firm physical basis. It can be used nevertheless for the
purpose of illustration and dimensional analysis.

[38] Thus one may conclude that during the time interval from 500 to 350 s before the shock crossing, on the 2s timescale, satellites C, and C, observe field-aligned
current tubes with a perpendicular cross section of the
order of 60 km and a parallel size >600 km. Satellites C,
and C; also observe similar structures on the 2-s timescale
in this region. The space separations in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field 6R |). ~ 650 km and 6R 1) 74 ~

290 km is not much larger than 6R, 14, but during 20 s
before T, there are no data on C3, so we cannot properly
compare structures observed by C3 with those discussed in
this section. More detailed comparisons between the four
satellites will be the subject of a future work. We can
conclude that just downstream of the region where coherent
Alfvén ion cyclotron waves are observed, one finds a region
more or less loosely filled with current tubes parallel to the
local ambient magnetic field.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

[39] It 1s well known, both theoretically and observationally, that AIC waves may be destabilized by proton and a
particle pressure anisotropies downstream of a quasiperpendicular, supercritical bow shock [Anderson et al.,
1994; Gary et al., 1994]. This is the case for the shock
crossing studied here, which falls in a regime of temperature
anisotropies and §,, where Alfvén ion cyclotron waves are
unstable. As predicted by previous authors, we observed
two AIC modes propagating approximately along the
downstream average magnetic field and corresponding to
the destabilizing effects of the a and proton temperature
anisotropies, in agreement with the linear theory of the
instability. Note that the identification of the waves
observed by one satellite was based on the polarization
study and on the wave vector direction obtained by the
minimum variance method. With the help of the four
Cluster satellites the determination of the wave dispersion
is possible. To our knowledge, an accurate AIC wave
identification in the downstream region of a quasiperpendicular shock is made here for the first time.

[40] Farther downstream in the magnetosheath but still
close to the shock front, the AIC waves disappear. Simultaneously, the pressure anisotropies decrease, and largeamplitude, localized fluctuations appear at timescales and
spatial scales smaller than the period and wavelength of the
AIC waves. These fluctuations may be interpreted as fieldaligned current tubes and last until the previous shock
crossing 1s reached at 1738:22 UT. No quasi-monochromatic
AIC waves are observed downstream of this shock, the
Cluster spacecraft finding themselves immediately in a
region with current tubes similar to those described below.

ALEXANDROVA ET AL.: ALFVEN WAVES AND FIELD-ALIGNED FILAMENTS

A05207

[41] Thus, in the downstream region of a perpendicular
bow shock, two different phenomena are observed successively: coherent, plane AIC waves propagating along B,,,;,,
followed by a region where the magnetic fluctuations take
the form of current tubes. Even if the geometry and the
length scales of the two phenomena are very different, they
are observed in adjacent regions. This is the most important
result of this work.

[42] A possible interpretation for the observed symmetry
breaking is the filamentation instability [Laveder et al.,
2002] of the quasi-monochromatic AIC waves observed
downstream of the shock. This instability takes place in a
plasma with 8 > 1 and leads to the collapse of the finite
amplitude dispersive Alfvén wave into intense field-aligned
magnetic filaments with a cross section of the order of c/w,;.
This instability has been extensively studied for parallelpropagating waves in Hall-MHD without kinetic effects. In
our case the conditions are favorable for the filamentation
instability. In particular, the total plasma 8 in the magnetosheath exceed the unity: (8, + Be)msn & 1.1. Furthermore,
the AIC characteristics, such as the frequency, wavelength,
and polarization and their direction of propagation, more or
less along the ambient magnetic field, are the correct ones
for the development of the instability. The cross section of
the current tubes is of the same order as the cross section
of the filament seen in the simulations [Laveder et al.,
2002]. The structure of this filament is rather complex: An
azimuthal magnetic field does not make a complete twist, an
axial component has a shear inside the filament, and
an electric current within the filament has the same structure
(D. Laveder, private communication, 2003). The model we
have used in this paper is highly schematic, and a detailed
study of the fine structure of the observed filaments will be
the subject of a forthcoming paper.

[43] The sequence of processes, discussed in this paper, 1s
summarized in the cartoon of Figure 11: The supercritical
quasi-perpendicular bow shock is the source of the strong
downstream temperature anisotropy which excites the AIC
waves; the waves give rise to the current tubes via the
filamentation instability. As mentioned in section 3, the
pressure anisotropy remains relatively high in the AIC
region and decreases in the tube region, indicating that the
filamentation instability plays an important role in the final
plasma relaxation in the downstream region.

[44] For the other shock crossings observed that day, the
solar wind and shock parameters were roughly in the same
range; it is therefore surprising that the combination of AIC
waves and current tubes was found for only one other shock
crossing, occurring at 1717:49 UT. However, for allofthem we
were able to identify field-aligned current tubes downstream
butclose to the shock front. This suggests that the filamentation
instability is so fast that AIC waves cannot be observed if the
geometry of the crossing is not favorable. Detailed comparisons with theoretical models of this nonlinear instability,
including kinetic effects, are necessary to support these
conclusions. This will be the subject of further studies.

Appendix A

Al. Wavelet Transformation: Basic Concepts

[45] In many cases of interest one has to analyze a signal
S(t) whose spectral content varies with time. The methods

which are commonly used to study this variation of the
spectral content (within the limits of the uncertainty principle, which states that one cannot obtain arbitrary good
localization simultaneously in time and frequency, AfAt >
C’) are the windowed Fourier transform (WFT) and the
wavelet transform (WT).

[46] In the WFT, time localization is achieved by using a
windowing function g(f) and then taking the Fourier transform

+00

S(t)g(t — te P™ at’,

ost.) = |

—OOo

where g(f) is a real function which vanishes for t > 7: This
transform is energy preserving and invertible. It 1s
characterized by the fact that the analyzing kernel g(f —
f)e2*" has the same support for all f and t, while the
number of cycles varies with f,| with the consequence
that frequency resolution is Af ~ 1/T and the time
localization At ~ T does not depend on the frequency.

[47] In the WT one uses an analyzing function which
has a narrow support for high frequencies and a large
one for low frequencies. This is achieved by using a twoparameter family of functions called wavelets, Well )=
JVfu[ f(¢ — )], derived from a “mother” wavelet (0),
which has a finite support around ¢ = 0. One of the
parameters is the translation parameter ¢, as in the win
ALEXANDROVA ET AL.: ALFVEN WAVES AND FIELD-ALIGNED FILAMENTS

A05207

dowed Fourier transform case; the other parameter is a
dilation (or scale) parameter f > 0 corresponding to a local
frequency, 1/f being the temporal scale. Making the
convolution of the signal S(t) with a member of the family
of functions Well), we obtain the corresponding wavelet
coefficient

ws(f.t) = [si vFulsld ~ lad

[48] Changing the value of f has the effect of dilating
(1/f > 1) or contracting (1/f < 1) the analyzing function
At), while changing ¢ has the effect of translating the
support of this function toward the point ¢. In the wavelet
transform the number of cycles in the wavelet W,-(¢) does
not change with the scale parameter 1/f, but the size of its
support does. It is small for small 1/f, so the wavelet
transform picks up higher-frequency components and vice
versa. The choice of the function W(t) 1s not unique, but
W(t) must have a finite energy, a sufficiently fast decay for
large values of |t} and zero mean.

[49] The signals we have to deal with are discrete ones,
with a sampling time ¢,. A complete orthogonal wavelet
basis may then be constructed if a logarithmic uniform
discretization of spacing and scales is chosen, for
example,

At scale m the time resolution is 2”t, = At.

[so] In this work we have used two wavelet transforms,
depending on whether we need a good time resolution or
a good frequency resolution [see, e.g., Kumar and
Foufoula-Georgiou, 1994]. The first one is the Haar
wavelet (HW),

l, O<t<1/2

w(t)=4—-1, 1/2<t<1

0, elsewhere.

Note that computing the Haar coefficients of a sampled
signal S(t;) at a given scale m is equivalent to taking the
difference between the average of the signal over two
consecutive intervals of length 2” points. At the highest
scale this procedure is equivalent to taking the difference
between two neighboring points of the signal, which
provides the highest time resolution but the worst frequency
resolution of the transformation. Therefore the HW transform is convenient for detecting fast and local variations,
which we call the “singular points.’’ The second WT is the
Morlet wavelet

(t) _ qt e (2nft) oF /2

where (27 f ) > 5, which represents a good compromise
between time and scale resolution; it is well suited

to detecting frequency peaks in an inhomogeneous
environment.

A2. Data Merging

[51] The search coil (SC) magnetometer of the STAFF SC
experiment measures magnetic waveforms with a sampling
time of t, = 0.04 s in the normal bit rate mode. Frequencies
smaller than the spacecraft spin rate (1/tr, tr ~ 4 Ss)
are filtered out so that the useful signal covers the 0.25—
12.5 Hz frequency range. In many cases, however, it is
convenient to have magnetic waveforms which also contain
information about the large-scale variations, information
which may be found in the FGM data, averaged, and
sampled at 4 s. We are therefore led to merge the STAFF
SC signal with the FGM signal, which can be done in many
ways.

[52] Here we use the Haar wavelet transform (the WFT
could be used as well, the main requirement being that the
transform is invertible). To illustrate the procedure, consider
the Xth component of the magnetic field [B,(f)]- measured
by FGM (see Figure Ala) and [Bx(f)|; measured by STAFF
SC (see Figure Alb). We begin by interpolating the [B,(2)|signal to the STAFF measurement times; then we apply the
Haar wavelet transform to both the STAFF waveforms and
the interpolated FGM waveforms, obtaining the wavelet
coefficients [WB y(m, t)]s; and [WB,(m, f)|z, respectively.
The period of rotation lies in the m = m,, = 6 scale since
2"* < te < 2™**! We then combine these two sets of
wavelet coefficients to obtain the wavelet coefficients
[WBy(m, t)|mix of a mixed signal, equal to [WBy(m, t)|r
for scales larger than m,, and to [WBy (m, t)]s for scales
smaller than m,,:

[WBx(m,t) | nix = Gm|WBy(m,t) |p + bm|WBx(m, t) |<,

mix
where a,, and 5,, are weight functions

m> Mx

m<Mx

by = 1— ap.

We now apply the inverse wavelet transformation using the
set of [WBy(f, D|mix to get the final “mixed” signal
[By{t)|mix (See Figure Alc). In Figure Ald we also present
the FGM high-resolution signal to compare with our
resulting signal. One can see that the signals are very
similar, with the fluctuation amplitude being slightly higher
for the high-resolution FGM data than for the merged
signal; a more detailed comparison of these two signals will
be made in a future work.
