<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Establishing the mechanisms by which the solar wind enters Earth's magnetosphere is one of the biggest goals of magnetospheric physics, as it forms the basis of space weather phenomena such as magnetic storms and aurorae <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . It is generally believed that magnetic reconnection is the dominant process, especially during southward solar-wind magnetic field conditions when the solar-wind and geomagnetic fields are antiparallel at the lowlatitude magnetopause <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . But the plasma content in the outer magnetosphere increases during northward solar-wind magnetic field conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , contrary to expectation if reconnection is dominant. Here we show that during northward solar-wind magnetic field conditions-in the absence of active reconnection at low latitudes-there is a solar-wind transport mechanism associated with the nonlinear phase of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . This can supply plasma sources for various space weather phenomena.</p><p>Along the outer boundary of Earth's magnetosphere, there is a boundary layer that contains plasma of dominantly solar-wind origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>). The boundary layer exists for all orientations of the solar-wind magnetic field, but it tends to be thicker when the solar-wind field points northward <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . The existence of the boundary layer implies penetration of solar wind across the magnetopause. Although reconnection between solar-wind and terrestrial magnetic fields can readily account for solar-wind entry during southward solar-wind magnetic field conditions, it is at present not known how the plasma crosses the magnetopause when the solar-wind magnetic field is oriented northward and parallel to geomagnetic fields and reconnection is less efficient, although there is a suggestion that simultaneous northern and southern cusp reconnection could result in the formation of the boundary layer at low latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Several candidate local entry mechanisms unrelated to reconnection have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , one of which is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) that could occur along the flanks of the magnetosphere where the shocked solar wind is flowing fast relative to the stagnant magnetospheric plasma 9,10 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Recent numerical simulation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> suggest that fast plasma transport across the magnetopause can be accomplished by the KHI only when the KHI has grown sufficiently to form rolled-up vortices that can engulf plasmas from both sides of the magnetopause. In these models, the collapse of, or reconnection within, such a vortex (in the nonlinear phase of the KHI) is responsible for the plasma transport.</p><p>Multiple and quasi-periodic encounters by spacecraft with the magnetopause and vortex-like flow perturbations near the magnetopause have been reported, and are often interpreted as representing surface waves or vortices excited by the KHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> . But as long as these signatures are observed only by a single spacecraft, one cannot tell unambiguously whether the KHI has reached its nonlinear stage and is generating rolled-up vortices, which are the crucial ingredient for plasma transport, or if they are just ripples or small-amplitude Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices on the magnetopause surface. The KH rolled-up vortex expected to form at the magnetopause has complex structures, such as vortical plasma flow and a filament-like high density region intruding into the low density (magnetospheric) region (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To resolve such complex structures in the KH vortices, multipoint in situ measurements as carried out by the Cluster mission are essential, as is comparison with realistic three-dimensional (3D) plasma simulations.</p><p>Here we report multi-spacecraft measurements that provide unambiguous evidence for rolled-up vortices at the flank magnetopause as well as simultaneously observed boundary-layer characteristics that result from plasma transport across the boundary, such as would be expected from the suggested KHI mechanism.</p><p>The four Cluster spacecraft forming a tetrahedron made a The KHI occurs at the interface between the solar wind and the plasma sheet because the plasma energy dominates in both regions, whereas it does not occur at the surface of the lobes where the magnetic energy dominates and the magnetic tension prevents it from deforming the magnetopause. Consequently, the KH vortices evolve only along the low-latitude magnetopause and only low-latitude portions of the magnetospheric and solar-wind field lines are entrained into the vortices, inducing characteristic field perturbations in regions off the equatorial plane where the Cluster spacecraft were located. The satellites were situated at (x, y, z) &lt; (23, 19, 23) Earth radii (R E ) in GSM (geocentric solar magnetospheric) coordinates, and were separated by ,2,000 km from each other. The coordinate system in the figures is defined such that 2x is in the direction of motion of the vortex structure which was sliding anti-sunward in the spacecraft frame, y points outward along the magnetopause normal, and z points to the north. b, Vortex structure resulting from a 3D numerical simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic KHI under a magnetosphere-like geometry, with the plasma sheet sandwiched between the two lobes. Colour-coded is the plasma density (minimum, 0 cm 23 ; maximum, 5.0 cm 23 ) in an x-y cross-section cut below the equatorial plane. The density, velocity and magnetic field variations expected when a synthetic satellite passes through the centre of the KH vortices to the left are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>letters to nature fortuitous direct encounter with the rolled-up vortices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) on 20 November 2001 when the upstream solar-wind magnetic field observed by the ACE spacecraft pointed northward, that is, when reconnection was less efficient but the condition was favourable for the KHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> at the low-latitude magnetopause. The solar-wind and magnetospheric magnetic fields on the dusk flank magnetopause were approximately parallel throughout the 16 min interval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f, g</ref>). The period of the vortices encounter was embedded in a more than 13-h interval of quasi-periodic plasma and magnetic field perturbations related to deformations of the magnetopause (09:30-23:30 UT). Rolled-up vortices were identified far more clearly by taking full advantage of multi-spacecraft information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>). The flow vectors, transformed into the frame of the vortices and viewed from the north, rotate anticlockwise around the centre of the vortices (marked by the red vertical lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), as expected at the duskside magnetopause. Near these vortices, the density observed by the Cluster 1 spacecraft (C1) located farthest from the magnetopause (marked by the blue arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) toward the magnetosphere was often higher than that observed by C3 or C4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c, d</ref>). These instances of higher density at C1 are marked by red bars in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>. Such high density regions appear to be connected to the dense solar wind on the anti-sunward side, for example, at 20:27:30 UT in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, rather than detached from the solar-wind region. This feature is consistent with the simulation result (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>), and indicates that the dense regions result from the of the solar-wind plasma associated with the growth of the KHI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>), not from the impulsive penetration process <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . The density variation observed by C1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) is similar to that expected when a synthetic spacecraft moves through the central portion of the simulated vortex and crosses the magnetopause back and forth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>), suggesting that C1 was in the vicinity of the centre of the vortices.</p><p>In addition to the density and flow signatures of the rolled-up KH vortices, we identified a unique magnetic field perturbation pattern associated with these vortices, which should appear only in a 3D configuration of the magnetosphere where the KH-unstable plasma sheet is sandwiched between the KH-stable northern and southern lobes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>). A numerical simulation of the KHI that considers this 3D magnetosphere-like geometry predicts that this field perturbation manifests in boundary regions between the plasma sheet and the lobes. This is because only low-latitude portions of the field lines surrounding the magnetopause are engulfed into the vortices, while those at high latitudes are unaffected (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1 legend</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref> shows that magnetic field perturbations seen in the high density (solar-wind) region (DB x . 0 and DB y , 0) and in the low density (magnetospheric) region (DB x , 0 and DB y . 0) have polarities in precise agreement with the 3D KHI effect on the magnetic field on the southward side of the equatorial plane where Cluster resided (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>). The combined plasma and magnetic field observations provide unambiguous identification of rolled-up . Time progresses to the left, and is translated into the position of the spacecraft as follows. In Earth's rest frame, the spacecraft motion is neglected as compared to that of the vortices. 2x is in the direction of the vortex motion in the spacecraft frame. The vortex velocity, V mean , is computed by averaging over the above interval the ion bulk velocity vectors measured by C1, C3 and C4. The spacecraft position is determined using an equation, x ¼ jV mean jt þ Dx i1 ; where t is time elapsed from the start of the interval, and Dx i1 is the x position of the ith spacecraft relative to C1. The arrows at the bottom denote the moments when the spectra and velocity distributions shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> were observed. b, The ion temperature obtained by C1.

The spacecraft separation distance and the length of the arrows are doubled in the y direction. g, The z component of the measured magnetic field. vortices at the magnetopause, which, according to theory, is a key (and necessary) ingredient for plasma transport via KHI.</p><p>Evidence for plasma transport across the magnetopause was indeed observed. Cold solar-wind and hot magnetospheric ion populations are found to coexist in the vortices (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a, 3</ref>). Significant amounts of the solar-wind (,2 keV) and magnetospheric (.5 keV) ions were detected simultaneously in the same region on the magnetosphere side of the magnetopause. The appearance of rolled-up vortices in the vicinity of the boundary layer is strongly suggestive of the KHI mechanism for plasma transport across the boundary.</p><p>We could not deduce the exact microphysical process that leads to plasma transport within the KH vortices on the basis of the present measurements. However, we could rule out local reconnection, because during the interval of the vortex observations, we did not find signatures of plasma acceleration due to magnetic stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and D-shaped ion distributions characteristic of reconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . To exclude, conclusively, the possibility of remote (high-latitude) reconnection supplying the plasma observed at low latitude is more difficult. We do note, however, that the boundary layer ions, detected off the equator, were flowing poleward in precisely the same direction as the solar-wind flow. This seems inconsistent with the idea that high-latitude magnetopause reconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , which would result in an equatorward flow at the observation point, produced the observed boundary layer. These observations thus indicate that reconnection occurred neither locally nor at the high-latitude magnetopause during the time of the observations of KH vortices. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that reconnection occurred in the past (but had ceased to exist) to produce a boundary layer which is now rolled-up by the KHI. Proving the existence of such a scenario is, however, even more difficult.</p><p>We estimate the speed of motion of the vortices by averaging over the vortices' interval the velocity values measured by the three spacecraft (C1, C3 and C4) on which the plasma instruments were operative. Time is then translated into distance of the spacecraft from a certain position in a vortex, and the length scale of one vortex is estimated to be 40,000-55,000 km (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Consequently, the initial thickness of the velocity shear layer is inferred to have been roughly 5,000-7,000 km, because the wavelength of the fastest growing KH mode is approximately eight times the initial total thickness of the velocity shear layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . According to numerical simulations, the width of the sufficiently developed KH vortex equivalent to that of the plasma boundary layer reaches about four times the initial thickness. We therefore infer that the boundary layer with the thickness of 20,000-28,000 km had been formed in the most KH-unstable low-latitude regions near, or at least further downstream of, the observation site.</p><p>The present results indicate that the KHI occurs at the flank magnetopause and that it may lead to solar-wind entry, perhaps via non-reconnection-associated processes, for northward solar-wind magnetic field. But the microphysical process that causes the plasma transport in the KH vortices, which would control the rate at which mass and energy of the solar wind are transferred, remain to be understood. The identification of the transport processes requires high-resolution measurements capable of resolving small-scale structures and dynamics embedded in the vortices. Such observations (which will be carried out by the future NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and the Japanese SCOPE mission) would enable us to determine the relative contributions of reconnection and the KHI during northward solar-wind magnetic field conditions.</p><p>A </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>letters to nature</head><p>Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting the ferroelectric transition temperature (T c ) is traditionally accomplished by chemical substitution-as in Ba x Sr 12x TiO 3 , the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which the dielectric constant (e r ) at GHz frequencies is tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees 3 , which is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An alternative way to adjust T c in ferroelectric films is strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate can be harnessed to increase T c by hundreds of degrees and produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at any temperature. This strain-induced enhancement in T c is the largest ever reported. Spatially resolved images of the local polarization state reveal a uniformity that far exceeds films tailored by chemical substitution. The high e r at room temperature in these films (nearly 7,000 at 10 GHz) and its sharp dependence on electric field are promising for device applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</p><p>Enormous strains can be imparted to thin films and have previously been used to alter the T c of ferromagnetic 9,10 and super-conducting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> materials. For such phenomena, strain-induced enhancements in T c as large as tens of degrees have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Owing to the strong coupling between strain and ferroelectricity, much larger T c shifts are expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , in ferroelectric materials.</p><p>In its pure, unstressed form, strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) is an incipient ferroelectric. It remains paraelectric down to 0 K, although chemical <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> or isotopic substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , as well as the application of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , easily disturb this delicate state, resulting in ferroelectricity. The boundary conditions imposed by a substrate profoundly affect ferroelectricity in thin films. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the predicted 4 shift in T c for SrTiO 3 (ref. 17) under biaxial strain e s ¼ (a k -a 0 )/a 0 , where a 0 is the lattice parameter of free-standing SrTiO 3 and a k is the in-plane lattice parameter of a biaxially strained (100) SrTiO 3 film. The hatched region shows the range in predicted T c due to the spread in reported property coefficients for SrTiO 3 (refs 18, 19)  that enter into the thermodynamic analysis. For example, for positive e s and T . 120 K, the enhancement in T c is given by DT</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">c ¼ 2e s e 0 CðQ 11 þ Q 12 Þ=ðs 11 þ s 12 Þ</formula><p>, where e 0 is the permittivity of free space, C is the Curie constant, Q 11 and Q 12 are the electrostrictive coefficients, and s 11 and s 12 are elastic compliances of SrTiO 3 . The breadth of the hatched region in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for T c is mainly due to the nearly factor-of-two variation in the ratio of (</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q 11 þ Q 12 )/(s 11 þ s 12 )</formula><p>for what are considered the most accurate reported values of these constants. These predictions imply that a biaxial tensile strain of order 1% will shift the T c of SrTiO 3 to the vicinity of room temperature.</p><p>In practice, the synthesis of uniformly strained ferroelectric films is challenging. Epitaxial ferroelectric films are usually grown to thicknesses greatly exceeding their critical values, resulting in undesirable relaxation towards a zero-strain state by the introduction of dislocations. Dislocation densities of ,10 11 cm 22 are typical in epitaxial Ba x Sr 12x TiO 3 films 20 , and the resulting inhomogeneous strain further smears the phase transition, in addition to the effects of chemical heterogeneity mentioned above. Our approach to controlling the properties of ferroelectric SrTiO 3 films centres on the development of new substrates that enable the growth of uniformly strained films below, or at least far closer to, the critical thickness for relaxation.</p><p>Depending on the choice of substrate, films may be grown under compressive or tensile strain.

The velocity gradient across the magnetopause increases with distance from the subsolar point. The KHI occurs at the interface between the solar wind and the plasma sheet because the plasma energy dominates in both regions, whereas it does not occur at the surface of the lobes where the magnetic energy dominates and the magnetic tension prevents it from deforming the magnetopause. Consequently, the KH vortices evolve only along the low-latitude magnetopause and only low-latitude portions of the magnetospheric and solar-wind field lines are entrained into the vortices, inducing characteristic field perturbations in regions off the equatorial plane where the Cluster spacecraft were located.
