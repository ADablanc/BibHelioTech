Establishing the mechanisms by which the solar wind enters
Earth’s magnetosphere is one of the biggest goals of magnetospheric physics, as it forms the basis of space weather phenomena
such as magnetic storms and aurorae’. It is generally believed
that magnetic reconnection is the dominant process, especially
during southward solar-wind magnetic field conditions when the
solar-wind and geomagnetic fields are antiparallel at the lowlatitude magnetopause’. But the plasma content in the outer
magnetosphere increases during northward solar-wind magnetic
field conditions**, contrary to expectation if reconnection is
dominant. Here we show that during northward solar-wind
magnetic field conditions—in the absence of active reconnection
at low latitudes—there is a solar-wind transport mechanism
associated with the nonlinear phase of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability’. This can supply plasma sources for various space
weather phenomena.

Along the outer boundary of Earth’s magnetosphere, there is a
boundary layer that contains plasma of dominantly solar-wind
origin® (Fig. 1a). The boundary layer exists for all orientations of
the solar-wind magnetic field, but it tends to be thicker when the
solar-wind field points northward**. The existence of the boundary
layer implies penetration of solar wind across the magnetopause.
Although reconnection between solar-wind and terrestrial magnetic
fields can readily account for solar-wind entry during southward
solar-wind magnetic field conditions, it is at present not known how
the plasma crosses the magnetopause when the solar-wind magnetic
field is oriented northward and parallel to geomagnetic fields and
reconnection is less efficient, although there is a suggestion that
simultaneous northern and southern cusp reconnection could
result in the formation of the boundary layer at low latitudes’.
Several candidate local entry mechanisms unrelated to reconnection
have been proposed*®, one of which is the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI) that could occur along the flanks of the magnetosphere where the shocked solar wind is flowing fast relative to the
stagnant magnetospheric plasma”’® (Fig. 1). Recent numerical
simulation models'''® suggest that fast plasma transport across
the magnetopause can be accomplished by the KHI only when the
KHI has grown sufficiently to form rolled-up vortices that can
engulf plasmas from both sides of the magnetopause. In these
models, the collapse of, or reconnection within, such a vortex (in
the nonlinear phase of the KHI) is responsible for the plasma
transport.

Multiple and quasi-periodic encounters by spacecraft with the
magnetopause and vortex-like flow perturbations near the magnetopause have been reported, and are often interpreted as representing surface waves or vortices excited by the KHI'’™". But as long as

these signatures are observed only by a single spacecraft, one cannot
tell unambiguously whether the KHI has reached its nonlinear stage
and is generating rolled-up vortices, which are the crucial ingredient
for plasma transport, or if they are just ripples or small-amplitude
Kelvin—Helmholtz (KH) vortices on the magnetopause surface. The
KH rolled-up vortex expected to form at the magnetopause has
complex structures, such as vortical plasma flow and a filament-like
high density region intruding into the low density (magnetospheric) region (see Fig. 1). To resolve such complex structures in
the KH vortices, multipoint im situ measurements as carried out by
the Cluster mission are essential, as is comparison with realistic
three-dimensional (3D) plasma simulations.

Here we report multi-spacecraft measurements that provide
unambiguous evidence for rolled-up vortices at the flank magnetopause as well as simultaneously observed boundary-layer characteristics that result from plasma transport across the boundary, such
as would be expected from the suggested KHI mechanism.

signatures of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). a, View of the magnetosphere, showing
the KH vortices at the duskside magnetopause. The velocity gradient across the
magnetopause increases with distance from the subsolar point. The KHI occurs at the
interface between the solar wind and the plasma sheet because the plasma energy
dominates in both regions, whereas it does not occur at the surface of the lobes where the
magnetic energy dominates and the magnetic tension prevents it from deforming the
magnetopause. Consequently, the KH vortices evolve only along the low-latitude
magnetopause and only low-latitude portions of the magnetospheric and solar-wind field
lines are entrained into the vortices, inducing characteristic field perturbations in regions
off the equatorial plane where the Cluster spacecraft were located. The satellites were
situated at (x, y, 2 ~ (—3, 19, —3) Earth radii (A) in GSM (geocentric solar
magnetospheric) coordinates, and were separated by ~2,000 km from each other. The

fortuitous direct encounter with the rolled-up vortices (Fig. 2) on
20 November 2001 when the upstream solar-wind magnetic field
observed by the ACE spacecraft pointed northward, that is, when
reconnection was less efficient but the condition was favourable for
the KHI* at the low-latitude magnetopause. The solar-wind and
magnetospheric magnetic fields on the dusk flank magnetopause
were approximately parallel throughout the 16min interval
(Fig. 2f, g). The period of the vortices encounter was embedded
in a more than 13-h interval of quasi-periodic plasma and magnetic
field perturbations related to deformations of the magnetopause
(09:30—23:30 UT). Rolled-up vortices were identified far more
clearly by taking full advantage of multi-spacecraft information
(Fig. 2e). The flow vectors, transformed into the frame of the
vortices and viewed from the north, rotate anticlockwise around
the centre of the vortices (marked by the red vertical lines in Fig. 2),
as expected at the duskside magnetopause. Near these vortices, the
density observed by the Cluster 1 spacecraft (C1) located farthest
from the magnetopause (marked by the blue arrows in Fig. 2b)
toward the magnetosphere was often higher than that observed by
C3 or C4 (Fig. 2c, d). These instances of higher density at Cl are
marked by red bars in Fig. 2c. Such high density regions appear to be
connected to the dense solar wind on the anti-sunward side, for
example, at 20:27:30 UT in Fig. 2d, rather than detached from the
solar-wind region. This feature is consistent with the simulation
result (Fig. 1b), and indicates that the dense regions result from the

Log(energy flux) (keV s

roll-up of the solar-wind plasma associated with the growth of the
KHI (Fig. 1b), not from the impulsive penetration process**. The
density variation observed by Cl (Fig. 2c) is similar to that expected
when a synthetic spacecraft moves through the central portion of
the simulated vortex and crosses the magnetopause back and forth
(Fig. 1b), suggesting that C1 was in the vicinity of the centre of the
vortices.

In addition to the density and flow signatures of the rolled-up KH
vortices, we identified a unique magnetic field perturbation pattern
associated with these vortices, which should appear only in a 3D
configuration of the magnetosphere where the KH-unstable plasma
sheet is sandwiched between the KH-stable northern and southern
lobes (Fig. la). A numerical simulation of the KHI that considers
this 3D magnetosphere-like geometry predicts that this field perturbation manifests in boundary regions between the plasma sheet
and the lobes. This is because only low-latitude portions of the field
lines surrounding the magnetopause are engulfed into the vortices,
while those at high latitudes are unaffected (see Fig. 1 legend).
Figure 2f shows that magnetic field perturbations seen in the high
density (solar-wind) region (AB, > 0 and AB, < 0) and in the low
density (magnetospheric) region (AB, <0 and AB, > 0) have
polarities in precise agreement with the 3D KHI effect on the
magnetic field on the southward side of the equatorial plane
where Cluster resided (Fig. 1a). The combined plasma and magnetic
field observations provide unambiguous identification of rolled-up

vortices at the magnetopause, which, according to theory, is a key
(and necessary) ingredient for plasma transport via KHI.

Evidence for plasma transport across the magnetopause was
indeed observed. Cold solar-wind and hot magnetospheric ion
populations are found to coexist in the vortices (Figs 2a, 3).
Significant amounts of the solar-wind (<2 keV) and magnetospheric (>5keV) ions were detected simultaneously in the same
region on the magnetosphere side of the magnetopause. The
appearance of rolled-up vortices in the vicinity of the boundary
layer is strongly suggestive of the KHI mechanism for plasma
transport across the boundary.

We could not deduce the exact microphysical process that leads to
plasma transport within the KH vortices on the basis of the present
measurements. However, we could rule out local reconnection,
because during the interval of the vortex observations, we did not
find signatures of plasma acceleration due to magnetic stresses**”°
(see Supplementary Fig. 1) and D-shaped ion distributions characteristic of reconnection”. To exclude, conclusively, the possibility of
remote (high-latitude) reconnection supplying the plasma observed
at low latitude is more difficult. We do note, however, that the
boundary layer ions, detected off the equator, were flowing poleward in precisely the same direction as the solar-wind flow. This
seems inconsistent with the idea that high-latitude magnetopause
reconnection’’, which would result in an equatorward flow at the
observation point, produced the observed boundary layer. These
observations thus indicate that reconnection occurred neither
locally nor at the high-latitude magnetopause during the time of
the observations of KH vortices. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that reconnection occurred in the past (but had ceased to
exist) to produce a boundary layer which is now rolled-up by the
KHI. Proving the existence of such a scenario is, however, even more
difficult.

We estimate the speed of motion of the vortices by averaging over
the vortices’ interval the velocity values measured by the three
spacecraft (C1, C3 and C4) on which the plasma instruments were
operative. Time is then translated into distance of the spacecraft
from a certain position in a vortex, and the length scale of one vortex
is estimated to be 40,000—55,000 km (see Fig. 2). Consequently, the

initial thickness of the velocity shear layer is inferred to have been
roughly 5,000-—7,000 km, because the wavelength of the fastest
growing KH mode is approximately eight times the initial total
thickness of the velocity shear layer*®. According to numerical
simulations, the width of the sufficiently developed KH vortex
equivalent to that of the plasma boundary layer reaches about
four times the initial thickness. We therefore infer that the boundary
layer with the thickness of 20,000—28,000 km had been formed in
the most KH-unstable low-latitude regions near, or at least further
downstream of, the observation site.

The present results indicate that the KHI occurs at the flank
magnetopause and that it may lead to solar-wind entry, perhaps via
non-reconnection-associated processes, for northward solar-wind
magnetic field. But the microphysical process that causes the plasma
transport in the KH vortices, which would control the rate at which
mass and energy of the solar wind are transferred, remain to be
understood. The identification of the transport processes requires
high-resolution measurements capable of resolving small-scale
structures and dynamics embedded in the vortices. Such observations (which will be carried out by the future NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale mission*? and the Japanese SCOPE mission)
would enable us to determine the relative contributions of reconnection and the KHI during northward solar-wind magnetic field
conditions. L

Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the
vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting
the ferroelectric transition temperature (T,) is traditionally
accomplished by chemical substitution—as in Ba,Sr,_,TiOs,
the material widely investigated for microwave devices in
which the dielectric constant (€,.) at GHz frequencies is tuned
by applying a quasi-static electric field’’. Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can
broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees’, which is
detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An
alternative way to adjust T, in ferroelectric films is strain* *. Here
we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate
can be harnessed to increase T, by hundreds of degrees and
produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at any temperature. This strain-induced enhancement in T, is the largest
ever reported. Spatially resolved images of the local polarization
state reveal a uniformity that far exceeds films tailored by
chemical substitution. The high ¢e, at room temperature in
these films (nearly 7,000 at 10GHz) and its sharp dependence
on electric field are promising for device applications’.
Enormous strains can be imparted to thin films and have
previously been used to alter the T. of ferromagnetic”’® and super

conducting'’'* materials. For such phenomena, strain-induced

enhancements in T, as large as tens of degrees have been observed’.
Owing to the strong coupling between strain and ferroelectricity,
much larger T. shifts are expected*®, and have been observed””*, in
ferroelectric materials.

In its pure, unstressed form, strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is an
incipient ferroelectric. It remains paraelectric down to 0 K, although
chemical’*"” or isotopic substitution”®, as well as the application of
stress’, easily disturb this delicate state, resulting in ferroelectricity.
The boundary conditions imposed by a substrate profoundly affect
ferroelectricity in thin films. Figure 1 shows the predicted’ shift in T,
for SrTiO; (ref. 17) under biaxial strain €, = (a\|-ag)/ao, where ao
is the lattice parameter of free-standing SrTiO; and ay is the
in-plane lattice parameter of a biaxially strained (100) SrTiO;
film. The hatched region shows the range in predicted T, due to
the spread in reported property coefficients for SrTiO; (refs 18, 19)
that enter into the thermodynamic analysis. For example, for
positive e, and T > 120K, the enhancement in T, is given by
AT. = 2€,€9C(Qi1 + Qi2)/(S11 + $12)> where € 0 is the permittivity
of free space, C is the Curie constant, Q,, and Q) > are the
electrostrictive coefficients, and s,,; and s,, are elastic compliances
of SrTiO3. The breadth of the hatched region in Fig. 1 for T, is
mainly due to the nearly factor-of-two variation in the ratio of
(Qi, + Qy2)/(511 + $12) for what are considered the most accurate
reported values of these constants. These predictions imply that a
biaxial tensile strain of order 1% will shift the T. of SrTiO3 to the
vicinity of room temperature.

In practice, the synthesis of uniformly strained ferroelectric films
is challenging. Epitaxial ferroelectric films are usually grown to
thicknesses greatly exceeding their critical values, resulting in
undesirable relaxation towards a zero-strain state by the introduction of dislocations. Dislocation densities of ~10'' cm’ are typical
in epitaxial Ba,Sr,—,TiO3 films’°, and the resulting inhomogeneous
strain further smears the phase transition, in addition to the effects
of chemical heterogeneity mentioned above. Our approach to
controlling the properties of ferroelectric SrTiO; films centres on
the development of new substrates that enable the growth of
uniformly strained films below, or at least far closer to, the critical
thickness for relaxation.

Depending on the choice of substrate, films may be grown under
compressive or tensile strain. Commercially available substrates that
