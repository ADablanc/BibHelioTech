Balogh® Magnetic reconnection in a current sheet converts magnetic energy into particle energy, a process that is important in many laboratory’, space”’ and astrophysical contexts*®.
It is not known at present whether reconnection is fundamentally a process that can occur over an extended region in space or whether it is patchy and unpredictable in nature’.
Frequent reports of small-scale flux ropes and flow channels associated with reconnection®* in the Earth’s magnetosphere raise the possibility that reconnection is intrinsically patchy, with each reconnection X-line (the line along which oppositely directed magnetic field lines reconnect) extending at most a few Earth radii (Rg), even though the associated current sheets span many tens or hundreds of Ry.
Here we report three-spacecraft observations of accelerated flow associated with reconnection in a current sheet embedded in the solar wind flow, where the reconnection X-line extended at least 390R_, (or 2.5 X 10°km).
Observations of this and 27 similar events imply that reconnection is fundamentally a large-scale process.
Patchy reconnection observed in the Earth’s magnetosphere is therefore likely to be a geophysical effect associated with fluctuating boundary conditions, rather than a fundamental property of reconnection.
Our observations also reveal, surprisingly, that reconnection can operate in a quasi-steady-state manner even when undriven by the external flow.
Until recently, in situ observations of reconnection in space plasmas were made almost exclusively in the Earth’s magnetosphere, in current sheets formed by the interaction between the solar wind and the geomagnetic field.
Such current sheets have finite extents, and their boundary conditions (determined by the solar wind magnetic field) often change rapidly.
It is generally difficult to establish the presence of an extended reconnection X-line in the magnetosphere from in situ measurements since that requires the presence of widely separated spacecraft detecting the same reconnection events.
The chances of such conjunctions are exceedingly small because the spacecraft are seldom ideally positioned for such observations and because of the variable boundary conditions.
The single event reported where two spacecraft (separated by 3R,) detected the same reconnection event at the magnetopause only allowed the deduction that the X-line was at least 3R_ long'*.
Remote observations of proton auroras’ and ionospheric convection”® have hinted at the presence of a magnetopause X-line up to 40R, in length but that has not yet been confirmed by in situ observations.
The recent discovery of reconnection exhausts in the solar wind'”* introduces a new laboratory where reconnection can be investigated by in situ measurements.
The solar wind reconnection events are often associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections, and the magnetic field orientations on the two sides of the current sheets are ACE (236 xX, -33 y, 23 2) Cluster (14x,109,52) (9 %, -321 ¥, 16 2) Jet Figure 1 | Diagram of the encounters of three spacecraft with an extended (390R_) magnetic reconnection X-line in the solar wind.
Reconnection in the current sheet (in blue) occurs at the X-line between magnetic field lines with large anti-parallel components B,, and By»; the resulting bi-directional plasma jets (confined to the reconnection exhausts) can be observed far from the X-line.
The ACE, Cluster and Wind spacecraft positions are shown in units of Earth radius (Rx) and in geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) coordinates with the x-axis pointing from Earth to Sun, the y-axis pointing towards dusk and the z-axis parallel to the ecliptic pole.
All three spacecraft were relatively close to the ecliptic plane (in yellow).
ACE was 222R, upstream of Cluster while Wind was 331R , dawnward of Cluster.
Also shown is the LMN current sheet coordinate system, with N along the overall current sheet normal, M along the X-line direction and L along the anti-parallel magnetic field direction.
The current sheet normal (0.71x, 0.60y, —0.37Z) in GSE, is tilted 45° relative to the Sun—Earth line.
The X-line is oriented along (0.47x, —0.79y, —0.392z) in GSE.
The thick solid red line is the (390R_x) portion of the X-line whose effect is observed by the three spacecraft.
The solid orange lines denote the spacecraft trajectory relative to the solar wind, with the red line portion marking the intersections of the exhaust with the spacecraft.
The total reconnected magnetic flux (= Vin Biilxiine OF Vin 2Bi Ll x-tine) is determined by the inflow velocity, Vin» the strength of the anti-parallel field components, B;, and the length of the X-line, Lyx jine.
The angle of the diverging exhausts is exaggerated for illustration.
The actual calculated angle is ~4°.

The magnetic field rotated 140° across the exhaust.

The combination of extended current sheets with stable boundary conditions and the fact that the solar wind rapidly convects the exhausts past observing spacecraft make these solar wind reconnection events ideal for addressing the question of extended versus patchy reconnection without complications due to boundary effects.
On 2 February 2002, the Wind, ACE and Cluster spacecraft were all in the solar wind (Fig.
1).
Cluster was 14R_ upstream (sunward) of the Earth.
ACE was 222R, further upstream of Cluster, while Wind, in its furthest orbit from Earth during its 10-yr mission, was located at 331R, dawnward of Cluster (and 321R, from the Sun—Earth line).
Figure 2 shows that all three spacecraft detected the passage of the same bifurcated current sheet with accelerated plasma flow embedded in it.
The total magnetic field rotation (or shear) across the bifurcated current sheet was 140°.
The observed plasma acceleration within the exhaust agreed with the reconnection prediction to within 5° in direction and 10% in flow speed (see Fig.
3c and d for more details).
This is consistent with the plasma acceleration being accomplished by the magnetic tension force associated with linkage of the magnetic field across the exhaust.
Furthermore, Fig.
3 shows that the plasma density and temperature were sharply enhanced at the edges of the current sheet while the magnetic field strength was reduced.
These signatures are consistent with the Petscheck’’ model of fast reconnection, where the reconnection exhaust is bounded by Alfven and/or slow mode waves.
The plasma and field signatures just described are typical of solar wind reconnection exhausts'”'*.
What is significant about this 2 February 2002 event is the fact that the reconnection exhaust was observed by three widely separated spacecraft, which allows the deduction of a long reconnection X-line.
The extent of the X-line that can be measured depends on the orientation of the exhaust and of the X-line relative to the spacecraft.
176 NATURE|Vol 439]12 January 2006 Cluster Cluster Vv, + 300 km s7 03:00 Time (UT) 04:00 exhaust was enhanced by ~50 kms relative to the ambient solar wind flow speed.
The velocity components were correlated (anti-correlated) with the components of the magnetic field at the leading (trailing) edge of the exhaust, as expected from reconnection sunward and northward of the spacecraft.
It is concluded that all three (widely separated) spacecraft detected essentially the same reconnection signature.
The abrupt changes in the magnetic field B, at the two edges and a plateau in the B, profile in the middle of the current sheet indicate that the current sheet is bifurcated.
To obtain the X-line orientation, one first needs to determine the exhaust geometry.
The bifurcated current sheet associated with the reconnection exhaust was convecting with the solar wind, and was first detected at ACE at ~01:32 uT, followed by Cluster an hour later (at ~02:32 UT) and 2.5h later than at ACE by Wind (at ~03:57 uT).
The fact that Cluster and Wind detected the current sheet 85min apart even though both spacecraft were at nearly the same distance from the Sun (but 330Rp, apart in dawn—dusk direction) implies that the current sheet must make a large angle relative to the ‘east—west’ direction (that is, relative to the y direction in Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinates; see Fig.
1).
This angle is confirmed by the analysis of the current sheet geometry at Wind.
The normal to the current sheet tilt was determined by minimum variance analysis”° of the magnetic field across the current sheet, and was found to be (0.71x, 0.60y, —0.37Z) in GSE.
The resulting error in the propagation time from ACE to Cluster is 4 min 20s, or 7%.
From ACE to Wind, the error is only 6s, or 0.07%.
This agreement demonstrates that the current sheet was indeed approximately flat on a scale of hundreds of Earth radii (or 0.01 AU) and that the current sheet normal was accurate.
The small magnitude of the normal magnetic field (By) across the current sheet (Fig.
3e) further confirms the accuracy of the current sheet normal.
The X-line orientation (0.47x, —0.79y, —0.39Z) in GSE is obtained from the components of the magnetic field in the current sheet plane’'.
From the X-line orientation one can determine, based on the locations where the three spacecraft intersected the current sheet, that Cluster and Wind detected flow from positions along the X-line that were 390R, apart, while ACE detected flow from the X-line at an intermediate location (see Fig.
1).
This implies that the X-line extended at least 390R, (or 4 X 10° ion inertial lengths) and very probably a great deal further.
If reconnection were patchy, one or © 2006 Nature Publishing Group NATURE|Vol 439]12 January 2006 es 20 ; ee = b Cc d e 03:55 04:00 Time (UT) 04:05 hh:mm  02 Feb 2002  Figure 3 | Quantitative comparison between the flow acceleration observed by the Wind spacecraft and the prediction from reconnection.
a, The ion density; b, the parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures; c, the observed and (reconnection) predicted plasma flow speed; d, the observed and predicted (in black) plasma velocity in LMN coordinates; and e, the magnetic field in LMN coordinates.
The anti-parallel component of the magnetic field (B,) was nearly equal in magnitude on the two sides of the exhaust.
The guide field (along the M or X-line direction) was ~4 nT, or 35% of the anti-parallel field.
The flow velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field (vy) was nearly constant (except for a small shift of 5 kms — ') across the bifurcated current sheet.
The 5kms ' shift in vj corresponds to a normal reconnection inflow vy rec of 2.5 km s ' (or a dimensionless reconnection rate, VN rec/V alfvens Of 3.3%).
The flow predictions in ¢ and d are based on the local magnetic field measurements and the reference velocity and magnetic field: Vpredicted — Vreference = (1 — a patbnenae) a(T oP eefenenca) ~Me [Bo reibremes P — Breference] (refs 25, 26).
The positive (negative) sign is chosen for the leading (trailing) edge of the bifurcated current sheet.
w = (p/; — p |) o/B” is the pressure anisotropy factor, p is the plasma mass density.
The left (right) dashed line in c and d denotes the reference times for the prediction of reconnection flow acceleration at the leading (trailing) edge of the exhaust.
The leading and trailing edge predictions merge at 03:59 UT.
The agreement between the predicted and observed flow is excellent in both the magnitude (c) and the components of the velocity (d).
This level of agreement is similar to other reconnection exhaust events in the solar wind’’, more spacecraft most probably would not have encountered accelerated flow.
Another fact that is consistent with a coherent and extended X-line is that the reconnection jets detected by all three spacecraft were directed in the same direction, implying that the X-line was north of all spacecraft.
Patchy and random reconnection could result in different spacecraft detecting jets directed in different directions.
In addition to finding an extended X-line, the fact that the three spacecraft detected the reconnection exhaust over a period of 2.5h implies that reconnection must have been quasi-steady over at least that time span.
This finding is similar to reports of quasi-steady reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause *.
An important difference is that while reconnection is strongly driven at the magnetopause (by the solar wind impinging on the Earth’s magnetosphere), reconnection in the present case appears to have been largely LETTERS undriven.
There was a discontinuity in the flow speed across the current sheet of 27kms_ '; however, Fig.
3d shows that much of the flow speed discontinuity was due to a 22kms ° shear in the flow component tangential to the current sheet which does not compress the current sheet.
In the normal direction the velocity across the current sheet was nearly constant except for a small 5kms * shift.
The velocity shift was consistent with a normal inflow, in the frame of the current sheet, of VN pec = 2.5kms ' associated with reconnection (at the position of Wind).
The fact that reconnection can be quasi-steady in the undriven regime is surprising, and has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge.
Finally, with a 12-nT magnetic field convecting into the reconnection region at 2.5kms * (for a dimensionless reconnection rate, VNrec/Vattven Of 3.3%, where Valfyven = B(u op)” is the Alfven speed), the reconnection electric field was 0.03 mVm_ *.
Along an X-line of at least 390R», the minimum reconnection potential was thus 75 kV.
Although we have shown detailed observations from a single event, our conclusions in terms of extended X-lines and steady reconnection are general.
We have identified 27 additional events when both ACE and Wind were in the solar wind and detected essentially the same reconnection signatures, irrespective of how far apart (in space and time) the two spacecraft were.
Common among all 28 events is the fact that the plasma 6 (the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure) in the ambient solar wind (outside the exhausts) is less than unity’” (<6 > 29 events = 0.4 + 0.2), a condition that has been suggested to be necessary for the occurrence of reconnection’.
In four of these cases, we have evidence for an X-line extending more than 100R x.
We are aware of no counter-examples where one spacecraft detected the reconnection signature and the other did not.
The large number of dual-spacecraft detections of reconnection flow with no counter-examples strongly indicate that reconnection in the solar wind, and probably in other astrophysical domains as well, can operate in a large-scale (much larger than the ion inertial scale) and quasi-steady mode, leading to the release of large amount of magnetic energy.
Our finding also raises an interesting question: how does the reconnection X-line become so extended? We suspect that in the case of the solar wind, reconnection starts in a limited region in the solar wind current sheet closer to the Sun and spreads with time from its initiation region.
By the time the current sheet reaches 1 Au, the X-line has reached hundreds of R; or more.
The true size of the solar wind X-line can be investigated by the upcoming NASA/STEREO mission, which will provide large spacecraft separations that exceed 1 AU in the GSE-y direction.
