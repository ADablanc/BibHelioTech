Abstract We present multipoint observations of earthward moving dipolarization fronts and energetic
particle injections from NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission with a focus on electron acceleration.
From acase study during a substorm on 02 August 2015, we find that electrons are only accelerated over a finite
energy range, from a lower energy threshold at ~7—9 keV up to an upper energy cutoff in the hundreds of keV
range. At energies lower than the threshold energy, electron fluxes decrease, potentially due to precipitation
by strong parallel electrostatic wavefields or initial sources in the lobes. Electrons at energies higher than the
threshold are accelerated cumulatively by a series of impulsive magnetic dipolarization events. This case
demonstrates how the upper energy cutoff increases, in this case from ~130 keV to >500 keV, with each
dipolarization/injection during sustained activity. We also present a simple model accounting for these energy
limits that reveals that electron energization is dominated by betatron acceleration.

1. Introduction

Earth's magnetosphere is constantly being driven by interactions with the solar wind. A global convection
cycle [Dungey, 1961], involving magnetic reconnection at sites along the dayside magnetopause under
southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions [e.g., Burch et al., 2016] and in the magnetotail
on the nightside [e.g., Wieroset et al., 2002], drives plasma throughout the magnetospheric system. Due to
the turbulent nature of the solar wind, such reconnection is rarely steady state but instead, typically occurs
in bursts that sporadically load Earth’s magnetotail with magnetic flux. This loading subsequently results in
sporadic and localized reconnection in the magnetotail, the manifestations of which include plasmoids
ejected antiearthward [e.g., Kiehas et al., 2012], bursty bulk flows (BBFs) [Angelopoulos et al., 1992], and
dipolarization fronts [e.g., Runov et al., 2012] that travel earthward, and ultimately—provided sufficient
instability in the system—auroral substorms [e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 2008].

Energetic particle injections are one of the classic signatures of substorm activity [e.g., Baker et al., 1982;
Reeves et al., 1996; Sergeev et al., 1998], which involves the sudden enhancement of tens to hundreds of
keV ion and/or electron intensities in the near-Earth plasma sheet [e.g., Gabrielse et al., 2014] and inner magnetosphere (i.e., at and inside of geosynchronous orbit (GEO)) [e.g., Birn et al., 1998; Gkioulidou et al., 2015;
Turner et al., 2015]. After reconnection occurs in the magnetotail, particles may be accelerated by interactions
with the earthward propagating reconnection exhaust jet (i.e., dipolarization front) [e.g., Birn et al., 2012, and
references therein]. The most successful models of energetic particle injections to date involved strong
azimuthal electric fields associated with dipolarization fronts propagating earthward in the magnetotail
[e.g., Liet al., 1998; Yang et al., 2011; Gabrielse et al., 2012; Birn et al., 2013, and references therein]. Test-particle
simulations in such fields established that a strong electric field in the +y direction (in GSE or GSM coordinates)
accelerates ions and electrons that are drifting in the tail. For electrons, this acceleration typically conserves the

first adiabatic invariant, such that particles move inward to lower L shells while interacting with the electric
field. Electrons’ second adiabatic invariants are also conserved, so electrons experience Fermi acceleration in
addition to betatron. However, betatron acceleration in the magnetotail’s geometry is theoretically proportional to the change in B,, while Fermi acceleration should be proportional to B,’>, even with a change in
the perpendicular components of B, and thus, it is expected that betatron dominates over Fermi acceleration
for injections of energetic electrons [e.g., Tverskoy, 1969; Artemyev et al., 2012, and references therein].

Due to their frequency of occurrence [e.g., Birn et al., 1998; Gabrielse et al., 2014] and relation to wave generation in the inner magnetosphere, energetic particle injections are considered an important process concerning the sources of radiation belt electrons [e.g., Meredith et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2015] and the buildup of the
storm time ring current [Gkioulidou et al., 2015]. How electrons injected into the inner magnetosphere can be
accelerated to energies exceeding 1 MeV, as reported by Dai et al. [2015, and references therein], remains an
important outstanding question. In this letter, we present a case study from NASA's latest Heliospheric
mission to develop a better understanding of the nature and energy limits of energetic electron injections
associated with substorm activity.

2. Data

NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission [Burch et al., 2015] consists of four identically instrumented
spacecraft that were launched into 24h period, highly elliptical, near-equatorial orbits on 12 March 2015.
MMS spacecraft are instrumented with a suite of plasma, field, waves, and energetic particle instruments that
enable observations of plasma processes at unprecedented temporal resolution. Additionally, due to the
four-point nature of the mission, in which the spacecraft are held in a tetrahedron formation of variable spacing (tens to hundreds of kilometer) through particular regions of interest, MMS has ushered in a new era of
experimental space plasma physics at the electron kinetic scale. For this study, we employed data from the
Energetic Particle Detectors (EPD) instrument suite [Mauk et al., 2015], FIELDS instrument suite [Torbert
et al., 2014], and the Fast Plasma Instruments (FPI) [Pollock et al., 2016]. In particular, we analyzed data from
the Fly’s Eye Energetic Particle Spectrometers (FEEPS) [Blake et al., 2015] and the Energetic lon Spectrometers
(EIS) [Mauk et al., 2015], which measure distributions of energetic electrons and ions, including composition,
in the range from ~20 keV to >500 keV at a time resolution as high as once per 0.33 s (for FEEPS); the FP! Dual
Electron Spectrometers and Dual lon Spectrometers, which capture several eV to ~30 keV electron and ion
distributions and derived plasma moments with temporal resolution of 30ms and 150ms for electrons
and ions, respectively; the fluxgate magnetometers (FGM), which measure the local DC magnetic field
sampled at 128 Hz [Russell et al., 2014]; and the double probe electric field instruments, which measure the
local electric field from DC to 100 kHz [Torbert et al., 2014]. For this study, we used only periods with burst
mode data, when the instruments were all operating at their best temporal resolution. To provide a more
global context for the MMS observations, we also examined data from NASA’s Time History of Events and
Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) [Angelopoulos, 2008] and Van Allen Probes [Mauk et al.,
2012] missions and the Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites (LANL-GEO), as described below.

3. Event Overview

On 02 August 2015 at around 01:05 UT, the four MMS spacecraft were in a tetrahedron formation with interspacecraft separation of ~40 km (see Figures 1f and 1g) at ~20:30 magnetic local time (MLT) on the inbound
half of their orbit. Around this time, the solar wind was flowing at ~580 km/s with a density of ~2cm~°, and
the IMF was, on average, southward with a magnitude of ~6 nT. With a minimum of only —19 nT between
00:00 and 06:00 UT on 02 August, the SYM-H index revealed that there was no geomagnetic storm in progress
during this period (Figure 1e). However, the AE index (Figure 1d) revealed that a period of substorm activity
started at ~00:35 UT (potentially initiated by a southward turning of the IMF around 10 min before) and persisted until ~04:00 UT. At 01:05 UT, the AE index was 622 nT and the AL index was —396nT. See additional
plots of the solar wind and geomagnetic indices during this period in the Supporting Information S1.

Providing an overview of the period of interest for this study, Figures 1a—1c show plasma quantities observed
by all four MMS spacecraft, while Figure 2a shows electron fluxes and select plasma vector quantities from
MMS-1. Figure 1 also details some of the multipoint observation capability of the MMS constellation. All
four spacecraft observed intermittent fluctuations in the total magnetic field strength, an overall

dipolarization (as evident in the increase in the +z component of the magnetic field by a factor of ~2.7 over
the 8 min period shown in Figure 1) that occurred as a series of sudden and abrupt changes between 01:06
and 01:10 UT rather than a gradual change, and fast ion flows between 01:05 and 01:07 UT, often peaking
at >200km/s and consistent with BBFs. From EIS observations (see the supporting information), energetic
(>20 keV) proton enhancements started around 00:25 UT and continued through the period of interest
shown in Figure 1.

From Figure 2a, MMS observed a series of magnetic field dipolarizations, in which the B, component became
stronger at the same time as B, and/or By, became weaker. Several of the clearer signatures occurred at:
01:06:13, 01:06:25, 01:07:06, 01:08:16, and 01:09:22 UT (vertical gray lines in Figure 2a). As expected for dipolarization fronts in the magnetotail [e.g., Runov et al., 2012, and references therein], the dipolarization signatures were preceded or accompanied by enhanced ion flows in the +x direction (i.e., earthward) and the
corresponding enhancements in the +y component of the convective electric field. From the electron energy
spectra, it is also evident that each of these dipolarizations resulted in a strong enhancement of the energetic
electron population (i.e., > ~20 keV), which increased by upward of 3 orders of magnitude over the full series
of these dipolarizations. EIS electron intensities were consistent with those shown from FEEPS in Figure 2.

From the FEEPS data shown in Figure 2a-i, it is clear that each of the >50 keV electron enhancements was
dispersionless in nature, with all energies affected starting to increase at essentially the same time. This is
consistent with MMS actually observing the dipolarization fronts that are responsible for the injections
[e.g., Gabrielse et al., 2014]. Furthermore, the upper energy cutoff on the enhancements increases over the
period shown; that is, with each new injection, the high-energy limit of injected electrons increases. This
has important implications that we will discuss in the following sections.

Finally, from THEMIS observations (see the supporting information), the three THEMIS spacecraft observed the
first signs of activity in the form of dispersed energetic (>20 keV) electron injections starting at ~00:48 UT; at
least two dispersed electron injections were observed between 00:48 and 01:00 UT. Later, enhancements of
both energetic electrons and ions were observed after ~01:15 UT, and there was no clear sign of dipolarization
in the magnetic field, which was already strongly dominated by the +z component (note that THEMIS was on
the dayside). The two Van Allen Probes (RBSP A and RBSP B) were inbound from apogee at the time of interest,
with RBSP B ahead of RBSP A along their near-common orbit. There is evidence of a dispersed electron injection
observed by RBSP A starting at around 01:13 UT at energies up to 187 keV; this injection signature revealed a
dispersion of >30 min between 55 and 187 keV electrons, indicating that the electrons drifted significantly
in azimuth around the system prior to reaching the spacecraft. The LANL-GEO satellites observed three energetic electron injections between 00:30 and 01:30 UT at energies between 50 and 600 keV (see supporting
information). Based on the dispersion signatures, LANL-97A was nearest to the injection sites for the first two
injections and 1994-084 was nearest to the third, which occurred at ~01:10 UT. LANL-97A and 1994-084 were
located in GEO (near-equatorial at 6.6 Re) at ~01:30 MLT and 20:30 MLT, respectively, at 01:00 UT.

4. Analysis and Interpretation

Based on the combination of THEMIS, LANL-GEO, and MMS observations, the substorm activity in the plasma
sheet apparently started in the postmidnight MLT sector sometime around ~00:25 UT and then spread duskward across the tail to MMS by around 01:06 UT. The evidence for this includes energetic ion enhancements
observed at MMS around 00:25 UT with no dipolarization signatures, consistent with ions drifting from further
eastward; two near-dispersionless electron injections observed by LANL-97A in GEO at ~01:00 MLT between
00:30 and 00:50 UT; dispersed electron injections observed by THEMIS starting at ~00:48 UT; dispersionless electron injections and dipolarizations observed by MMS starting around 01:06 UT; and a near-dispersionless electron injection observed at 1994-084 in GEO at ~20:30 MLT around ~01:10 UT. With the combination of
observations, itis apparent that only avery small subset of energetic particle injections in the plasma sheet penetrate into the inner magnetosphere, which is consistent with previous results [e.g., Sergeev et al., 2012]. Of the at
least six electron injections observed by MMS and THEMIS, only three were observed by the LANL-GEO spacecraft and only one by Van Allen Probes inside of GEO. Furthermore, based on the MMS observations, the greater
dipolarization consisted of a series of many smaller dipolarization events that occurred in close succession.

Employing the close, four-point nature of the MMS constellation and multispacecraft analysis techniques
[Schmid et al., 2015, and references therein], we were able to calculate the propagation velocities of the five

clearest dipolarization front signatures assuming a planar front on the scale size of the spacecraft separation
(~40 km). As detailed in Schmid et al. [2015], velocities are calculated using timing analysis from cross correlation of the data from the four spacecraft. The timing analysis provides a good estimate of the propagation
properties of the dipolarization signatures. This analysis revealed that the fronts were all traveling in the +x
direction in GSM coordinates with the following velocities: [304, 58, 205], [299, 219, 80], [281, —44, 212],
[193, 63, 187], and [628, 170, 202] km/s from the timing analysis for the fronts at 01:06:13, 01:06:25,
01:07:06, 01:08:16, and 01:09:22 UT, respectively. Note that these fronts appeared to have been propagating
faster than the corresponding ion convection speeds shown in Figure 2; however, the observed ion velocity
magnitudes are partial moments from FPI only and were also contaminated by background radiation after
01:06 UT. All five front velocities also had significant y and z components, which likely resulted from the geometry of the dipolarizing field lines in the southern half of the magnetotail current sheet (note that B, is negative throughout this period). See the supporting information for additional details on these calculations and
their results. Since electrons in the tail drift earthward (i.e., in the +x direction) at soeeds independent of
energy but drift azimuthally at soeeds dependent on energy [e.g., Birn et al., 2013], the y and z components
of these propagation velocities are significant, as they may result in preferential electron acceleration at
specific energies and pitch angles due to drift resonance.

Electron distribution functions from a combination of FP] and FEEPS data are shown in Figure 3 (see also the
supporting information for the full distributions ranging from 10 eV to 600 keV). These distributions reveal the
evolution of the electron distribution function throughout the active period from 01:04:00 to 01:09:40 UT as
observed by MMS-1. From this figure, several main features are of interest here: (i) there is a threshold energy
between 7 and 9 keV above which electrons are accelerated and below which electrons are decelerated or
lost, (ii) there is an upper energy cutoff on each of the injections/enhancements that increases to higher
energy with each new injection, and (iii) electrons with energy >50 keV are predominantly accelerated in
the perpendicular direction, while electrons with energy <9 keV experience the most cooling and/or loss
in the perpendicular direction (Figure 3b). Note that observations here were made off the magnetic equator,

shown in the legend. Note that the times are listed in minutes and seconds (mmiss); all of them have the same hour, 01:00 UT. The error bars are +10 from the
averaging, and the black line with x marks shows the 1 c/s level for the FEEPS instruments. (b) A subset of the distributions resolved by pitch angle, with those for 90°

time periods are shown in Figure 3b. (c) The percent-difference between the initial distribution (01:04:00-01:05:00 UT) and each subsequent distribution (see legend
for corresponding times) as a function of energy. The red curves show where the percent difference was negative; these values have been multiplied by —1 to show
on the logarithmic scale. (d) The electron distributions from Figure 3a (in corresponding colors) but renormalized using the simple model from equations (1) and (2).
The initial distribution is the same as that from 04:00—05:00 in Figure 3a, but the remaining curves, which correspond to the distributions during/after each of the five
identified dipolarizations/injections, have been renormalized using the following model parameters: émin = [4, 6, 8, 10, 12] keV; émax =[150, 200, 320, 500, 600] keV;
Bif=[16, 21, 27, 25, 33] nT; BZ;= 11 nT. The five values given correspond to each of the distributions from injections 1 to 5, respectively, and these values are a
posteriori approximations from the actual MMS observations during this series of events.

such that local 90° pitch angles correspond to equatorial pitch angles estimated in the range of 45 to 60°.
Figure 3c more clearly shows the energy dependence of the acceleration and loss, with electrons somewhere
in the range of 30 to 50 keV experiencing the strongest percent increase from the acceleration: over the less
than 6 min period examined, the 50 keV electron population increased by approximately 2 x 10°%.

The amount of energy an electron gains from its interaction with a dipolarization front relates directly to the
amount of time it spends drifting through the azimuthally confined region of enhanced electric field that selfconsistently corresponds to the earthward propagating dipolarization of the magnetic field [e.g., Gabrielse
et al., 2012; Birn et al., 2012, 2013]. Since electrons should conserve their first and second adiabatic invariants

in this process, electrons that gain energy in this way will also move earthward to regions of stronger magnetic field (B, in particular, as shown in Tverskoy [1969]). Since electrons are also drifting in azimuth through
the tail, the limit to the amount of energy they can gain depends on the amount of time they spend in this
azimuthally limited, earthward surging pulse of enhanced electric field. Considering this model and the
observed energy limits and changes in B, corresponding to each of the dipolarizations/injections that
occurred in this event, we next show how only the ~10 to ~100 keV electrons were accelerated by every
dipolarization: below 10 keV, losses dominated over any acceleration, while above 100 keV, the upper energy
cutoff limited those electrons that were affected such that higher energy electrons were accelerated in only a
subset of the dipolarizations/injections.

By recognizing an upper energy cutoff that changes in time with each dipolarization/injection, betatron
acceleration corresponding to the observed changes in B, can be used to explain the majority of the
enhancements above the lower energy threshold, émin, using the following model:

ef = g(e)& — Emin (1)

where ¢; and é; are the electron initial and final energies before and after each dipolarization/injection, Emin is
the low energy threshold above which acceleration dominates over losses, and g(e) is a piecewise function in
the following form:

Bz f

<
g(e)= 2 Bz ™ (2)
1, E > Emax

where B,; and B,, are the initial and final values of the z component of the local magnetic field in each
dipolarization and émax is the upper energy cutoff, which changes with each new dipolarization and
corresponding injection of accelerated electrons.

Taking such a model into account with the a posteriori knowledge of the energy limits for each injection, émin
and Emax, We Can produce a series of renormalized energy distributions that do not change significantly in time
during the series of injections observed between 01:04:00 and 01:09:40 UT, as shown in Figure 3d. All of these
renormalized distributions converge upon the initial distribution, which implies that the electron distributions
were adiabatically uniform (i.e., the phase space density distributions for fixed first adiabatic invariant were
approximately flat) over the affected regions of the near-Earth plasma sheet. The only place that this model
does not fit well is at the highest energies, >100 keV, where the initial distribution is near instrument background levels (Figure 3a) and thus artificially higher than the actual distribution at those energies. Such a model
with an émax that increases with each new dipolarization/injection event is also consistent with the power law
index of the >50 keV electron distribution actually getting softer over time. From Figure 3a, the power law
index for 50-200 keV electrons evolved from —4.0 for the 01:04:00-01:05:00 UT distribution to —5.9 for the
01:09:20-01:09:40 UT distribution. This is consistent with the energy dependence of the acceleration and
how the electrons at lower energies experienced more acceleration than those at higher energies: those
electrons at energies between 50 keV and ~130 keV (i.e., émax for the first injection around 01:06:13 UT) were
accelerated in every dipolarization/injection event, while those at energies higher than each ém a, were not.

Though the model employed here uses only local observations of the magnetic field and electron distributions, it is still capable of describing the evolution of electrons injected from further down tail in the plasma
sheet. Model/simulation results have shown that strong azimuthal electric fields (Ey) in dipolarization fronts
surging earthward transport energetic ions and electrons earthward with them [eg., Li et al., 1998;
Gabrielse et al., 2012; Birn et al., 2012, 2013, 2014]. For the event examined here, the observations revealed
that the series of dipolarization fronts were indeed surging earthward at hundreds of km/s in the plasma
sheet with strong corresponding azimuthal electric fields. Thus, reason dictates that the suprathermal electrons observed in the tail should have been transported earthward when they encountered the observed
dipolarization fronts, and the acceleration process responsible for enhancing electrons between the threshold and cutoff energies was not a local process. Next, as shown from back tracing with test-particle simulations [e.g., Li et al., 1998; Gabrielse et al., 2012; Birn et al., 2014], different energy electrons originate from
different initial locations in the magnetotail. This framework leads to a major implication of our results: the
phase space density distributions of electrons as a function of the first adiabatic invariant, f(Mu), must have

been relatively uniform (i.e., there were no strong gradients) over a broad range of the plasma sheet prior to
the series of dipolarization/injection events. In that case, electrons could be transported to the MMS location
from a variety of initial locations with no major changes to the initial distribution when only accounting for
betatron acceleration.

To investigate the decrease in the distribution function of electrons with energies below the threshold at
around 7-9 keV, we examined the electric field observations from MMS-1 as shown in Figure 2 (see also
the supporting information). The broadband activity in the spectrograms are the result of the Fourier transform on trains of electron holes [e.g., Ergun et al., 2001] evident in the burst waveform data. MMS also
observed strong electrostatic wavefield components parallel to the background magnetic field. These strong
parallel electric fields occurred over a range of frequencies, with signals on the order of the electron cyclotron
frequency (approximately hundreds of hertz to kilohertz) carried on lower frequency (5-10 Hz) waves; this
and the large-amplitude nature of these waves imply that nonlinear effects were at work. The largestamplitude signals (tens of mV/m) are those at the lowest frequencies (see the supporting information). The
strong parallel electric field signatures are entirely limited to the period of the dipolarizations and electron
injections observed at MMS: 01:07:00-01:09:30 UT, as is clearest in the longer time period shown in the plots
in Figure 2b. From Van Allen Probes observations, Malaspina et al. [2015] showed that such parallel electric
field structures and nonlinear waves are well correlated to plasma boundaries, and Mozer et al. [2015, and
references therein] reviewed how such parallel electric field structures (aka, time domain structures) can
result in field-aligned distributions and enhanced precipitation into the atmosphere for hundreds of eV to
a few tens of keV electrons. Based on this context, we speculate that the ~100 eV to ~10 keV electrons below
the lower energy threshold here may have been predominantly scattered toward the loss cone by the strong
parallel electric fields associated with the dipolarization fronts and corresponding injections. Thus, these nonlinear electric field structures may play a critical role in setting the lower energy threshold for energetic electron injections; we present this here as a hypothesis to be tested in future studies. However, it must also be
noted that in test-particle simulations by Birn et al. [2014], they found a similar threshold energy at ~10 keV,
below which the flux of electrons as a function of energy decreased in dipolarization/injection events. They
attributed this flux decrease not to loss but to these electrons having originated in the plasma sheet boundary layer and/or lobes prior to the injection, where there was insufficient source of phase space density to
result in an enhancement after injection.

5. Conclusions

The results presented here provide a new perspective on a well-studied and important phenomenon:
energetic electron injections related to substorm activity. This study reports on the first in-depth observations
and analysis of energetic electron injections from MMS. For the event studied here, we observed a series of
dipolarization fronts and corresponding injections with unprecedented resolution electron data and studied
the evolution of the electron distribution function. In summary, the main conclusions from this case study
are as follows:

1. The global dipolarization associated with the substorm activity in this event was composed of a complex
substructure consisting of many, smaller, earthward moving dipolarization fronts. This is consistent with
the concept of dipolarizing flux bundles being the building blocks of the substorm current wedge [e.g,.,
Liu et al., 2014; Sergeev et al., 2014] and recent high-resolution global simulations revealing fine-scale
structure in the tail during substorm activity [e.g., Wiltberger et al., 2015]. With the four-point nature of
the MMS constellation, we were able to calculate the propagation speeds and directions of five of the clearest dipolarization fronts. This revealed that they were all traveling generally earthward at speeds between
276 and 681 km/s. As reported previously [e.g., Gabrielse et al., 2012; Sergeev et al., 2012], energetic electron
injections are impulsive in nature, occurring during each BBF and corresponding dipolarization front, and
only a small subset of all injections in the plasma sheet are able to penetrate inside of GEO.

2. There is an upper energy cutoff on the betatron and Fermi acceleration of electrons in the hundreds of
keV range at MMS during this event. This cutoff increases over time with ongoing activity, with the result
that the electron energy spectrum actually becomes softer over multiple, successive injections despite
there being strong enhancements in the range from ~10 keV up to the upper energy cutoff. In this one
case, the upper energy cutoff started around 130 keV and increased to over 500 keV over at least five
distinct dipolarizations/injections, and the net acceleration from all injections was most effective for

electrons between 30 and 50 keV. The pitch angle distributions are consistent with theory, showing that
betatron dominates over Fermi acceleration. The upper energy cutoff is consistent with a limit on
acceleration by the electric field associated with the earthward propagating dipolarization front [e.g.,
Birn et al., 2013], and the increase in the cutoff with each new dipolarization/injection implies that the
azimuthal extent of the dipolarization fronts became wider with sustained activity during this case.

3. There is a threshold energy, émin, around 7-9 keV, below which electron flux dramatically decreased. This
threshold energy is probably a transition point between where acceleration dominates (¢ > min) and
where cooling and/or losses dominate (é¢ < min). We speculate that electrons below the threshold energy
may be scattered toward the atmospheric loss cone by nonlinear parallel electrostatic wavefields, which
were also observed here and were apparently associated with the dipolarizations/injections. Alternatively,
electrons at these energies may trace back to initial locations in the plasma sheet boundary layer or lobes
where the distributions may provide an insufficient source to result in any enhancement of these particles,
as discussed in Birn et al. [2014].

4. Asimple model (equations (1) and (2)) can be used to explain most of the observed evolution of the electron
distribution function during the series of multiple dipolarizations and corresponding injections; this model
invokes only betatron acceleration and the observed upper and lower energy limits as described here.

The results from this event tie many results from previous studies [see Birn et al., 2012, and references therein]
together in one clear case, a case which also provides implications that shed new light on the complex nature
of substorms and reconnection in the magnetotail while highlighting the potential for MMS to push the limits
of our understanding of these important events in Earth’s magnetosphere. This case demonstrated that each
of a series of dipolarizations accelerates electrons over only a finite energy range, with subsequent fronts
accelerating electrons above the upper energy cutoffs reached by previous fronts. The injection threshold
and cutoff energies examined here are also qualitatively consistent with previous results from simulations
[e.g., see Figure 16 from Birn et al., 2012, 2014]. The evolution of the electron spectrum clearly showed the
cumulative effects of acceleration, with electron phase space density increasing predominantly due to betatron acceleration at energy > ~10 keV. This result has important implications for the effectiveness of energetic particle injections for supplying the inner magnetosphere with a source of tens to hundreds of keV
electrons. In future studies, it will be of interest to compare how the threshold energy and upper energy cutoffs change from event to event, as well as for isolated and localized dipolarization events that occur independent of a full substorm, and examine further details on the macroscopic (MHD scales) and microscopic
(localized nonlinear waves at kinetic scales) electric fields that dictate the upper and lower energy limits
for energetic electron injections.
