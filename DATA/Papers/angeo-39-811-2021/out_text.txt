Abstract. Out of the two Venus flybys that BepiColombo
uses aS a gravity assist manoeuvre to finally arrive at Mercury, the first took place on 15 October 2020. After passing the bow shock, the spacecraft travelled along the induced
magnetotail, crossing it mainly in the Yyso direction. In this
paper, the BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter Magnetometer (MPO-MAG) data are discussed, with support from
three other plasma instruments: the Planetary Ion Camera
(SERENA-PICAM) of the SERENA suite, the Mercury Electron Analyser (MEA), and the BepiColombo Radiation Monitor (BERM). Behind the bow shock crossing, the magnetic
field showed a draping pattern consistent with field lines connected to the interplanetary magnetic field wrapping around
the planet. This flyby showed a highly active magnetotail,
with e.g. strong flapping motions at a period of ~ 7 min.
This activity was driven by solar wind conditions. Just before this flyby, Venus’s induced magnetosphere was impacted
by a stealth coronal mass ejection, of which the trailing side
was still interacting with it during the flyby. This flyby is a
unique opportunity to study the full length and structure of

the induced magnetotail of Venus, indicating that the tail was
most likely still present at about 48 Venus radii.

1 Introduction

The interaction of Venus with the magnetoplasma of the solar
wind gives rise to the creation of a so-called induced magnetosphere (see e.g. Luhmann et al., 1986; Phillips and McComas, 1991; Bertucci et al., 2011; Dubinin et al., 2011;
Futaana et al., 2017). The solar wind is first braked by the
upstream bow shock and is then further mass-loaded and
slowed down due to the ionization of exospheric particles
and their pick-up by the solar wind convection electric field
whilst approaching the planet. The magnetic field is subsequently draped around the planet (e.g. Saunders and Russell,
1986) in what is often called a comet-like interaction.
Closer to the planet the magnetic field piles up in a region that is known under various names: magnetic pile-up
boundary, magnetic barrier, or magnetopause (Zhang et al.,

2008a, b). In this region, the interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) is stopped at the sunward side of the planet and cannot
penetrate into the ionosphere. This boundary extends downstream to at least 11 planetary radii and encloses the induced
magnetotail, where planetary plasma escape mainly occurs
(Bertucci et al., 2011). One more boundary is created through
the difference in plasma composition, where there is a strong
gradient in the energetic electrons and the ion population
starts to become dominated by planetary ions instead of solar wind ions (Martinecz et al., 2009a, b), the ion composition boundary. Finally, an additional boundary related to the
upper limit of the collisional ionosphere is typically found at
lower altitudes, the 1onopause. This boundary is where the
thermal ionospheric pressure balances the induced magnetosphere’s magnetic pressure (Bertucci et al., 2011); 1t occurs
mainly in the dayside and post-terminator nightside sectors.

In the dayside and upstream regions of the induced magnetosphere, various kinds of plasma waves are typically detected. In particular, two wave modes related to the pick-up
of freshly created ions (Gary, 1992) in Venus’s exosphere
play an important role. In the solar wind, proton cyclotron
waves are observed (Delva et al., 2008, 2015) created by the
ion pick-up in a relatively low plasma-f8 environment. Behind the quasi-perpendicular bow shock, mirror modes are
often found (Volwerk et al., 2008a, b, 2016) because of the
relatively high plasma-f there and the mainly perpendicularto-the-magnetic-field energization of the ions crossing the
bow shock.

In Venus’s downstream region the induced magnetotail 1s
created by the draped field lines, producing two regions of
an oppositely directed magnetic field separated by a current
sheet (Phillips and McComas, 1991), not unlike the Earth’s
magnetotail. The direction of the field in the tail 1s mainly
aligned with the direction of the solar wind, and the field in
the lobes is stronger than that in the magnetosheath (Russell
et al., 1981). A difference in wave power between the magnetosheath and the tail proper can also be seen (Russell et al.,
1981; V6roés et al., 2008a, b). As in the Earth’s magnetotail,
magnetic reconnection has been observed to take place (Volwerk et al., 2009, 2010; Zhang et al., 2010).

The first flythrough of Venus’s magnetotail was done by
Mariner 10 on 5 February 1974 (Lepping and Behannon,
1978), from as far downstream as ~ 100 Ry. In October 1975
the Venera 9 and 10 were injected into their very elongated
orbits, with a pericentre at ~ 1500 km and an apocentre at
~ 110000 km and an inclination of 30° (Verigin et al., 1978;
Eroshenko, 1979). The induced magnetosphere of Venus has
only been studied over a limited region of space because of
the limited orbital coverage of the visiting spacecraft. Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) did not explore the central region of the tail further than ~ 11.5 Ry downstream of Venus,
and Venus Express (VEX), due to a larger inclination of the
spacecraft orbit, did not venture beyond ~ 4 Ry downstream.
This means that the structure and the dynamics of the Venusian far tail have not been fully characterized yet. Important

questions are still open with respect to e.g. the length of the
tail and bow shock/wave along it: where does it “merge” with
the ambient solar wind? How do flux ropes and plasmoids
move through the far tail? Learning this will have strong implications for understanding the processes that encourage the
atmosphere to escape or shield it from doing so.

Recently, however, three newly launched missions have
performed flybys using Venus as a gravitational assist to get
into the correct orbit towards the inner solar system.

The first one was Parker Solar Probe (PSP, Fox et al.,
2016), which is set to use seven Venus flybys to adjust its perthelion distance. The first flyby was on 3 October 2018, the
second on 26 December 2019 approaching from the downstream direction, and the third on 11 July 2020, approaching from the upstream direction. The first flyby passed into
the induced magnetosphere, where strong kinetic-scale turbulence was found in the magnetosheath (Bowen et al., 2021)
as well as sub-proton-scale magnetic holes (Goodrich et al.,
2021), whereas the second flyby grazed Venus’s bow shock
at the dawn terminator and double layers were observed at
this boundary (Malaspina et al., 2020).

BepiColombo is the second new mission with two planned
Venus flybys (Benkhoff et al., 2010; Milillo et al., 2020;
Mangano et al., 2021), the first of which is the topic of
this paper. The third mission is Solar Orbiter (Miiller et al.,
2013, 2020), which had its first Venus flyby about 2 months
after the first BepiColombo flyby, on 27 December 2020.

This paper focuses on the first BepiColombo flyby that occurred on 15 October 2020. Since this flyby was the first
opportunity to have scientific planetary observations after
the instrumental tests performed during the Earth flyby on
10 April 2020, several science instruments were turned on for
this planetary encounter. The BepiColombo trajectory was
such that by making a long transit into the Venusian-induced
magnetotail, it allowed for a precious opportunity to study
the dynamics and structures of the tail, including the far tail,
a region mostly unexplored.

2 Thedata

The first Bep1Colombo flyby occurred on 15 October 2020,
with the closest approach at 03:58:31 UT and a minimum altitude of 10720.5 km above the planet surface (~ 2 Venus
radii). BepiColombo was in the solar wind and crossed the
Venusian bow shock on the day side in the evening sector, and then it did a long transit into the induced magnetotail. The flyby is shown in Fig. | in the Venus solar orbital
(VSO) coordinate system. In this figure, the Sun is to the left
(+Xvso), and the different plasma boundaries together with
BepiColombo’s trajectory are indicated.

The BepiColombo spacecraft (Anselmi and Scoon, 2001;
Benkhoff et al., 2010) is still in its cruise-phase configuration, which means that there is a stacked formation: the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), the Mercury Planetary Or

biter (MPO), the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface Structure (MOSIF), and the Mercury Magnetospheric
Orbiter (MIO). The main spacecraft MPO and MIO will first
be detached at Mercury orbit insertion. Naturally, this formation brings limitations to the onboard instruments. With
MIO behind the MOSIF heat shield many instruments will
be obstructed (see below) and the magnetometer boom cannot be deployed. For MPO the magnetometer boom could be
deployed; however, it is rather close to the MTM with its ion
drives and solar panels, which will create stray fields in the
measurements.

We use data from the BepiColombo magnetometer MPOMAG onboard the MPO spacecraft (Glassmeier et al., 2010;
Heyner et al., 2021), at a cadence of 1s (Fig. 2) and a lowpass filter for periods below 5 min (Fig. 3) in order to get
the large-scale structure of the induced magnetosphere undis

tion in the plane perpendicular to the Venus—Sun line, with
de = 0°/90° indicating a field in the Yysg/Zvso direction.
In Fig. 3 the magnetometer data are shown as well at the
cone and clock angles and the location of the spacecraft.

Data from the Planetary Ion Camera (PICAM), part of
the SERENA (Search for Exospheric Refilling and Emitted Natural Abundances) instrument suite (Orsini et al.,
2010, 2021a, b), are also used to support the magnetometer data. PICAM is an ion mass spectrometer, which operates
as an all-sky camera for charged particles. It is optimized
for Mercury’s observations to study the chain of processes
by which neutrals are ejected from Mercury’s soil and are
eventually ionized and transported through the Hermean environment. PICAM operates by scanning through the energy
and angular distribution of ions effectively from 10eV up to
3keV and with a field of view of 1.57 sr and a cadence of
64s. PICAM also provides ion composition for a mass range
extending up to ~ 132 u (Xenon).

Electron data from the Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (Saito et al., 2010; Saito et al., 2021) onboard the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO, renamed MIO after
launch) spacecraft of BepiColombo are also utilized. In particular, data from the Mercury Electron Analyzer (MEA) 1 in
solar wind mode (3—3000 eV) are used to investigate the lowenergy electron distribution during the flyby at a cadence of
4s. Since the MMO spacecraft is stuck behind the MOSIF
Sun shield during the cruise phase, MEA] has a limited field
of view but, despite this, useful scientific observations can be
obtained since low-energy electrons are almost isotropic.

In order to account for the solar wind activity responsible for the IMF disturbances around the Venus | flyby, data
from the BepiColombo Radiation Monitor (BERM) are used
(Pinto et al., 2021). BERM is a particle detector able to provide radiation information, in a way similar to the Standard
Radiation Environment Monitor (SREM) instrument aboard
several ESA missions such as Rosetta (Honig et al., 2019).
In particular, it is able to measure high-energy charged particles (e.g. electrons from ~ 100 keV to ~ 10 MeV and protons
from | to ~ 200 MeV), and the higher-energy channel background counts can be used as a proxy for galactic cosmic
rays.

Moreover, we also use data from the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument onboard
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite (SOHO)
(Brueckner et al., 1995). In particular, we use data from
the c2 white light coronagraph imaging from 1.5 to 6 solar
radii. We also use the Heliospheric Imager (HI) instrument,
which forms part of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and
Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) suite of remote sensing instruments onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A spacecraft. The HI is a wide-angle
visible-light imaging system for the detection of coronal
mass ejection (CME) events in interplanetary space covering the region of the heliosphere from 4 to 88° elongation
measured from the Sun’s centre (Howard et al., 2008; Eyles

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021

M. Volwerk et al.: BepiColombo Venus 1 flyby

et al., 2009). It consists of two telescopes, HI] and HI2: in
this study we have used only images from HI].

Finally, we have also used the Space-weather-forecastUsable System Anchored by Numerical Operations and Observations (SUSANOO) model from Nagoya University to
simulate the solar wind conditions encountered by BepiColombo at Venus during the flyby (Shiota et al., 2014; Shiota and Kataoka, 2016). SUSANOO is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solar wind model of the inner heliosphere between 25 and 425 solar radii using a yin—yang grid, where the
velocity, density, and temperature are obtained from empirical models of the solar wind (Odstréil and Pizzo, 1999a, b).
CMEs are included in the inner boundary of the simulation
as spheromak-type magnetic flux ropes (Shiota et al., 2014;
Shiota and Kataoka, 2016; Iwai et al., 2019) with initial velocities derived semi-automatically from SOHO-LASCO.

In Fig. 3 there are four regions marked by differently
coloured vertical lines, which will be discussed in more detail below. These intervals are also marked along the orbit of
the flyby in Fig. 1. The times when these regions were transited and the distance to the planet when they occurred are
listed in Table 1.

3 MPO-MAG observations

First the MPO-MAG data, based on the different regions as
listed in Table 1, will be discussed.

3.1 Magnetosheath draping

After crossing the bow shock at ~ 04:14 UT, the spacecraft
enters the Venusian magnetosheath. Fig. 4 shows a zoomin on the field in the magnetosheath. It is clear that after
the crossing of the bow shock (the first purple vertical line),
the magnetic field rotates strongly from B, (yellow) into B,
(red), which is also evident from the clock angle, @¢, that
turns from ~ 90 to ~ 0°. By, is the minor component in this
interval, as can clearly be seen in the cone angle, 6. ~ 90°.

This means that, in the magnetosheath, the magnetic field
is mainly in the Yyso direction, i.e. perpendicular to the induced magnetotail direction. This is reminiscent of the pattern described by Delva et al. (2017, their Fig. 1), where
draped magnetic field lines in the magnetosheath were connected to the IMF, albeit that BepiColombo makes a much
further excursion away from Venus, in this interval up to
Xvso © —4 Ry, than VEX. This draping pattern was shown
to exist in hybrid plasma simulations by Jarvinen et al.
(2013).

3.2 Magnetotail draping

After passing through the magnetosheath, there is a strong
rotation of the magnetic field, at ~ 04:44 UT, where B,, decreases and B, increases and the cone angle changes from
0. © 90 to © 150°, as seen in Fig. 5 between the second pur

takes on the shape of a magnetotail, with the main direction
along the Venus—Sun direction, albeit with a significant By
contribution.

Because of the conic shape of the bow shock behind
Venus, the magnetic field in the magnetosheath and magnetotail is not strictly along the Venus—Sun line but flares out

following this conic shape. A significant By contribution can
be caused by this flaring of the magnetotail. However, we
see in Fig. 5 that By < 0 and By > 0, which is incompatible
with flaring, for which one would expect By < 0. This means
that the “cross-tail magnetic field” By needs to have its origin elsewhere, e.g. from penetrating IMF into the tail. This
can be caused via reconnection of the induced magnetic field
with IMF structures. This process is well known from Earth
(e.g. Fairfield, 1979; Browett et al., 2017).

3.3. Neutral sheet crossing

At a bit further distance, BepiColombo encountered the neutral sheet. As can be seen in Fig. 5, at ~ 05:25 UT | B,| starts
to decrease again (B, — OnT) and after ~ 05:33 UT By, also
starts to decrease, to end up at a minimum of By © 3nT
around 05:43 UT, where then B, is the dominant component
for a short period of time; see Fig. 6. After 05:45 UT, there
is a drastic change in the cone angle from ~ 90 to ~ 180° as
well as large oscillations in B,, Bm, and in the clock angle
that varies between ~ 180 and ~ O°. There are three of these
oscillations, which then are followed by possible crossings
of the neutral sheet between 06:08 and 06:15 UT. These neutral sheet crossings are marked by blue vertical lines in Fig. 6
and are seen as By reaching ¥ 0° nT twice and the cone angle varying from ~ 150 to © 15°.

3.4 Magnetotail flapping
Between 06:46 and 07:01 UT there are multiple crossings of

B, = OnT, with By ~ —4nT and a negligible B, (see Fig. 7).
This behaviour is reminiscent of magnetotail flapping ob

served at Earth (Sergeev et al., 2003) and also evidenced in
the Hermean magnetotail (Poh et al., 2020).

At Venus, this phenomenon has also been observed by
Rong et al. (2015), with a period of ~ 3 min, which is much
shorter than the ~ 7 min period seen in Fig. 7.

One of the characteristics of flapping is that for consecutive crossings of B, =OnT the normal of the current sheet
oscillates in the Y—Z plane. We have performed a minimum
variance analysis on the four crossings to determine the normal direction to the current sheet. The results are shown in
Table 2. The determination of the direction normal to the current sheet appears robust, with eigenvalues well separated for
each case and Amax > Aint >> Amin. AS can be seen, the normal, n = (nx,nNy,nz), is mainly in the Y—Z plane. For flapping, one would expect then that for n, > O there is an alternately positive and negative value for n-,. This is only the
case for the last three crossings.

After these multiple crossings of B, =OnT, there are
two more excursions from one lobe to another, and then at
~ 07:45 UT the magnetic field strength basically arrives at
a more or less constant value of By ~ 5 nT (see Fig. 3). The
cone angle slowly rotates from 6, © 20 to 6. © 140° and then
rotates back again, which is a characteristic as well of flap

ping activity within the tail. The flapping period is about
7 min.

3.5 Exiting the bow shock

As BepiColombo continues its path down and across the tail,
it will eventually encounter the bow shock/wave again. It is
not clear what this structure may look like so far down the
tail, and thus from the magnetometer data it is difficult to
determine where this crossing happened.

In order to get an estimate of where the crossing could
have happened, we determine where the cone angle of the
magnetic field varies around the average Parker-spiral angle
of Op © 36°. This occurs around ~ 14:00 UT at distances of
Xvso © 48 Ry and Yyso © 11 Ry.

3.6 Magnetic slingshot effect

One phenomenon that may occur in the Venusian magnetotail
is the so-called magnetic slingshot effect, where draped magnetic field lines, after they have slipped over/diffused through
the ionosphere, appear as kinked field lines in the tail. The
kink represents a magnetic tension and ions will be accelerated by the J x B force, as observed with PVO (Slavin et al.,
1989).

Slowly, down the tail, the field line will “unkink’, which
means that a spacecraft travelling down the tail and moving
alternately into the two lobes of the tail, e.g. through flapping
motions, should see less rotation of the field. Slavin et al.
(1989) showed that at a distance of ~ 10-11 Ry, the rotations
of the field when PVO crossed the central current sheet were
close to Ad © 180° and associated accelerated Ht and OT
were observed.

With BepiColombo a very long trajectory through Venus’s
magnetotail was traversed. In Fig. 8 the low-pass-filtered (periods longer than 30min) cone angle is shown for 04:00—
23:00 UT, corresponding to Xvyso = 0... — 94 Ry. It was already determined above that the magnetotail is flapping, and

Figure 7. Zoom-in on the magnetotail flapping interval (red). The
cone angle clearly shows alternating magnetic field directions (tailward 6, > 90° and Venus-ward 6, < 90°). The clock angle remains
basically the same (¢c = 180° = ¢c = — 180°).

in this case large oscillations of the cone angle are investigated, where the spacecraft moves from one lobe into the
other. The extrema between the crossings of interest are labelled with numbers. The cone-angle change is listed in Table 3. One can see that there is a small trend that the rotation
A@, decreases as the spacecraft moves further down the tail.
However, the orbit of BepiColombo was not optimal for such
a study because of the large Zyso.

Figure 9 shows PICAM, MPO-MAG, and MEAI1 observations. The PICAM data in Fig. 9 (first panel, which are as-yet
uncalibrated but with the background noise removed) show
a strong signal of ~ | keV solar wind ions, both upstream of
the bow shock and inside the induced magnetotail. There are
variations in the energy of the observed protons Ep, especially in the downstream region of the bow shock, between
~ 04:45 and ~ 06:00 UT, with 6 x 10° < Ey <2 x 10° eV.
Clear bursts of increased counts occur at the same time as

Figure 8. The cone angle of the magnetic field calculated from low-pass-filtered data, for periods longer than 30 min, for the interval 04:00—
23:00 UT. The numbered peaks are used to calculate the change in cone angle as BepiColombo moves from one lobe to the other, which is
listed in Table 3. After 14:00 UT the spacecraft is assumed to have left the magnetotail and to be in the solar wind.

an increase in the MEA electron counts is seen at energies
between ~ 32 and ~ 100 eV. There are no measurements of
the S/C (spacecraft) potential, and therefore one caveat is that
the energies for both electrons and ions might have some
level of uncertainty. Nevertheless their trend should not be
affected, as the timescale for changes in the S/C potential is
often much longer than the time interval of interest.
Interestingly, after crossing the bow shock, there is no
clear reduction in the ion energy, which remains at solar wind
level until ~ 05:35 UT. This is caused by the location of the
bow shock crossing at ~ [—1.5, —2.3, —1.5] Ry, where the
reduction of the plasma velocity is much smaller than towards the sub-solar point (see e.g. Spreiter et al., 1966; Spreiter and Stahara, 1994; Schmid et al., 2021). Overall, however, the counts decrease when BepiColombo moves further
into the downstream region. There are a few significant increases in the count rate, marked by grey and blue transparent boxes in Fig. 9. The grey boxes are when the spacecraft
has entered the magnetotail, and there does not seem to be a
good correlation between the PICAM and MPO-MAG data
as far as these increases in counts are concerned. The first one
is during a rotation of the field from B, into By, the second
shows no real peculiarities in the MPO-MAG data, and the
third shows a strong dip in B,. The lack of one correlation
between MPO-MAG and PICAM could be due to the field of

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021

view of PICAM, which limits its visibility of the whole sky,
so that some ion jets might be missed in observations.

For the blue boxes, which occur during the period where
the magnetic field is oscillating strongly, there seems to be
a correlation between B,, and the PICAM count rate. The
bursts of high counts correlate very well with the decreases
in the total magnetic field.

Finally, during the interval labelled as “magnetotail flapping” (red-edged box), there is no increase in electron energy, but there is a decrease in counts in the low-energy bins
below 10 eV.

The MEAI instrument was turned on from 14 October 2020 03:45:07 UT until 16 October 2020 04:25:51 UT.
MEAI measured low-energy electrons during the flyby except during wheel off-loading. The time—energy spectrogram
of electron omnidirectional counts obtained every 4s in the
low-resolution telemetry mode is shown in Fig. 9f. Table 4
shows the crossing times of the various regions as deduced
from MEAI1 data. The times for some of the crossings are
slightly off with respect to the magnetometer data (see also
Table 1).

— The purple box is identified as the magnetosheath where
the magnetic field was mainly in the Yygo direction.
The MEA data show after 04:08 UT a different population of electrons than that of the solar wind. The

main population is at energies between 20 and 40 eV,
with some variation to lower energies as the spacecraft
moved deeper into the magnetosheath.

— The green box is identified as the magnetotail, where
the cone angle is & *¥ 150°. In the MEA data this region shows a much broader distribution of electron energies between 3 and 40eV. Between the purple and
green boxes a magnetic field rotation takes place from
0. © 90 to & & 150°. Already before the end of the purple box the electron energy distribution starts to broaden
and reaches a maximum energy width at 04:53 UT, later
than the rotation of the magnetic field. At the end of
the green box, the spacecraft seems to move near the
neutral sheet, with By < 3 nT, followed by strong oscillations in B, and By. The MEA data show two electron populations, one at 3-10 eV and one at 30-80 eV.
This splitting of the electron population can be caused
by acceleration through the electric field generated by
the magnetic field gradients.

— The blue box shows the actual crossing of a neutral
sheet, with By * OnT. Interestingly, there is no signature in the MEA data here, just a broad energy distribution of the electrons.

— The red box is the location of the “magnetotail flapping”, the multiple crossings of B, =OnT. The MEA
data show a decrease in the low-energy electron population.

4.2 Comparison to a Venus Express magnetotail
flapping event and interplanetary coronal mass
ejection (ICME) interaction

Venus Express (Svedhem et al., 2007) also observed
magnetotail flapping in the near-Venus tail around

https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-811-2021

(—1.5,0.1,0.5) Ry on 24 November 2007, as shown in
Fig. 10 and discussed by Rong et al. (2015). These authors
stated that, different from the Earth’s magnetotail, where
the source of flapping is expected at the centre (Sergeev
et al., 2003; Davey et al., 2012), the source of the flapping
in Venus’s tail is located near the boundaries between the
magnetotail current sheet and magnetosheath.

The second and third panels show the magnetometer data
(Zhang et al., 2006) B,,y,, and Bm. The first and fourth panels show the Analyser of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms,
ASPERA-4, IMA ion mass composition sensor-derived proton differential flux at a time resolution of 12s and the
ASPERA-4 ELS electron sensor-derived electron differential flux time—energy spectrogram at a time resolution of
4s (Barabash et al., 2007). The black (white) vertical dotted lines show where B, = OnT, and the two magenta vertical dotted lines show where VEX approaches B, = OnT but
does not cross over.

The IMA time-energy spectrogram shows some weak
bursts at =1 keV (most likely solar wind protons). At lower
energies, protons between ~ 20 and ~ 200 eV, there are three
bursts in the time—energy spectrogram. These seem to be correlated with VEX being in the lobes of the magnetotail, at
|B,| + 20nT. This is different from what was observed by
BepiColombo, where the PICAM bursts seemed to be correlated with minimal observed magnetic field strength.

The ELS spectrogram shows that when the spacecraft approaches the centre of the tail, the flux at higher energies
increases (near the vertical lines in Fig. 10), indicating that
there are more energetic electrons in the central plasma sheet
of Venus’s induced magnetotail. Note that the flux is strongly
reduced when VEX is in the lobes, whenever | B,.| increases,
indicating that the energetic electrons are a feature of the central plasma sheet.

There are, however, clear differences between the flapping
events as observed by BepiColombo and VEX. First of all,

Figure 9. Four hours of the Venus 1 flyby as seen by different instruments. Panel (a) shows the PICAM data, where the ~ | keV protons

are clearly visible before and behind the bow shock. The data gap near

~ 04:40 UT is caused by a mode change. Panels (b)—(e) show the

MAG data, B-field magnitude, and components. Panel (f) shows the linearly normalized MEA omnidirectional electron count time—energy
spectrogram. The coloured lines (purple, green, cyan, and red) and the shaded areas (transparent grey, transparent blue) show the different

intervals as defined in the text.

the flapping amplitude is about twice as large for VEX. Secondly, in the blue boxes in Fig. 9, where we see the splitting
of the electron populations, there are no B, =OnT crossings, so BepiColombo remains in one lobe of the induced
magnetotail. Later, in the red box, BepiColombo does cross
B, = OnT multiple times.

Comparing the electron energy distribution for MEA1 and
ELS for the blue boxes in Figs. 9 and 10, one can see that for
ELS there is no splitting of the electron population into two
energy bands. Also, ELS does not show a drop in flux at the
B, = OnT crossing, as is observed in the MEA1 data in the
red box.

Naturally, these differences may well be caused by the difference in location of the spacecraft with VEX near X ©
—1.5 Ry and BepiColombo near X ~ —15 Ry as well as the
different spacecraft speeds and instrument cadences.

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021

Dimmock et al. (2018) studied the interaction of an ICME
with the Venusian-induced magnetosphere, both with numerical simulations and VEX observations. They showed that the
magnetic environment around Venus can be strongly altered,
albeit mainly on the dayside, by bringing the bow shock more
planet-ward, increasing the field strength at the magnetic barrier up to a value of ~ 270nT and magnetizing the ionosphere. The field line draping pattern was similar to “regular”
conditions, although the simulation did not match the nightside draping pattern very well. The VEX data showed that
there were large amplitude oscillations in front of and behind the bow shock, which are assumed to be whistler waves.
Magnetotail dynamics are, unfortunately, not discussed.

4.3 Mariner 10, Galileo, and Pioneer Venus

As Mariner 10 was on its way to Mercury, it passed through
Venus’s magnetotail (wake) on 5 February 1974 in a similar orbit in the X—R plane as BepiColombo but at positive Z
(see Lepping and Behannon, 1978). The wake magnetic field
data were studied starting at a distance of ~ 100 Ry from
the planet. No evidence was found for a bow shock crossing entering the far tail. No typical magnetotail structure (as

https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-811-2021

compared to Earth) was observed, but the authors found that,
when the magnetic field direction and the spacecraft velocity vector aligned, the direction was not predominantly along
Xvso; as one would expect for a magnetotail along the orbit
of Mariner 10.

The data were categorized into three bins: quiet, disturbed,
and mixed. The longitudinal (cylindrical) component of the
field was observed to rotate clockwise, when the spacecraft
crossed from a quiet to a disturbed region. Lepping and

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021
822

Behannon (1978) interpreted this as Mariner 10 entering
into the planetary magnetotail, however with a significant Y
component for most crossings. The IMF, after Mariner 10
crossed the bow shock, exiting the induced magnetosphere,
was F = 20nT (in the paper denoted as 20y), @ © 360°, and
0 ~ 0° (Ness et al., 1974). This means a mostly radial magnetic field. These multiple crossings do not seem to happen
for BepiColombo. During the Solar Orbiter flyby such crossings were observed (Volwerk et al., 2021).

The Galileo spacecraft used a Venus gravitational assist on
its way to Jupiter. During this Venus flyby, the orbit skimmed
the bow shock. Kivelson et al. (1991) used the magnetometer
data to investigate the cross section of the bow shock. They
found that it seemed to be smaller when its direction was
aligned with the IMF when compared to when its direction
was perpendicular to the IMF.

Using Pioneer Venus data, Slavin et al. (1989) studied Venus’s near-tail region, at |X|<S12 Ry. Twelve passes
through the central induced magnetotail (in the period 198 1-—
1983) along Pioneer Venus’s polar orbit were studied, and
it was found that the spacecraft traversed the central current
sheet multiple times during each crossing. The quasi-period
of the crossings is <10 min (as estimated from their figures).
The spacecraft moved between clearly defined oppositely directed fields. This behaviour could be considered magnetotail
flapping; however, this was not yet a named phenomenon.

The main difference between the BepiColombo passage
through Venus’s tail and the orbits studied by Slavin et al.
(1989) is the IMF direction. For BepiColombo the IMF is
mainly in the Z direction, whereas for the Pioneer Venus
events the IMF is mainly in the Y direction. This means that
the morphology of the induced magnetotail is rather different. For the Pioneer Venus orbits the central current sheet
was almost in the X—Z plane, whereas for BepiColombo the
central current sheet is almost in the X—Y plane.

5 Solar wind interaction: context for Venus’s
magnetotail observations

5.1 BepiColombo solar wind conditions

Many of the features seen in the magnetometer data are in
good agreement with what one would expect for draped magnetic field lines from the solar wind inducing a magnetosphere around Venus. However, it is also clear that the solar
wind was disturbed based on the significant activity of the
tail such as the multiple neutral sheet crossings and flapping
of the tail.

In a pre-flyby study, McKenna-Lawlor et al. (2018) discussed the space weather near Venus during the BepiColombo flybys, where one could expect interactions with
e.g. ICMEs and corotating interaction regions (CIRs). However, during the actual BepiColombo flyby | our interpretation of the solar wind interaction with the induced mag

M. Volwerk et al.: BepiColombo Venus 1 flyby

netosphere is hampered by the lack of an upstream solar
wind monitor. Nevertheless, thanks to pre- and post-flyby
observations made by the MPO-MAG, BERM, and MEA1
instruments, together with observations made by STEREOA, SOHO, and a solar wind numerical simulation, the space
weather context of the encounter is reconstructed.

Figure 11 shows some STEREO and SOHO observations
of a potential CME that may have hit Venus during the BepiColombo flyby. The Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) catalogue reports a
single CME event for the period 7-13 October, which corresponds to the time needed for a CME to reach Venus by the
time of the BepiColombo flyby. The DONKI catalogue indicates that this event was observed by SOHO-LASCO c2, c3
and STEREO-A SECCHI instruments with a starting time on
10 October 2020 04:24 UT and a speed of 270.0 km s~!. This
specific DONKI run also lists a direction right on the western limb (with respect to Earth). Moreover, no clear source
eruption (filaments or prominence activity) in the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) imagery was observed. This event
is clearly seen by the SOHO-LASCO instrument in panels c
and d, where plasma outflows along a western limb streamer
seen from LI go into Venus’s direction (Venus was near in
quadrature with respect to Earth; see panel a).

However, the Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and
Techniques Service (HELCATS), which provides the official interplanetary CME catalogue of the STEREO HI instruments, reveals a rather different scenario. HELCATS (Harrison et al., 2018) catalogues the derivation of CME kinematic
properties (direction, speed, and launch time) from geometric
fitting techniques applied to the HI observations, described in
Davies et al. (2013). The technique applies a self-similar expansion (SSE) approach that assumes a circular CME topology, expanding within two fixed-position angles. The validity of this assumption depends on the nature of the particular event under study, and the derived parameters should
be regarded as best estimates in the spirit of that assumption. For the event under study (Fig. 10), the SSE fit suggests
that the HI-observed CME was a weak CME ejected by the
Sun on 9 October at 23:05 UT with a speed of 283kms7!.
The first observation of the CME by the HI1 camera was on
10 October at 10:09 UT, and the fit indicates that it was near
Earth-directed. No clear arrival was detected in the vicinity
of Earth, though the solar wind parameters do show some
signs of disturbance, though, of course, the CME might have
simply passed near to Earth. However, overall, we conclude
that there is some evidence that the near-simultaneous weak
CMEs observed by both STEREO-A and SOHO were not the
same; that is, we witness a near-Earth-directed CME from the
STEREO instrumentation and coincident CME activity associated with a streamer with the SOHO data that is directed
towards Venus. The SOHO-observed CME could well have
hit BepiColombo at the time of its first flyby to Venus.

In order to estimate the arrival time of this CME at Venus,
Fig. 12 shows the main outputs of a SUSANOO simulation.

transit, respectively. The white arrow indicates the plasma motion off the western limb, which is more evident at the movie created at the
SOHO Movie Theater (https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/data/Theater/, last access: 15 September 2021).

Panels a—c show three stills of the solar wind velocity in the
ecliptic plane. For completeness, the simulation has also included the following CME observed by SOHO-LASCO that
was ejected on 13 October 2020 at 21:12 UT, with a close
direction to Venus as well. Panels d—e show the same simulation in a 3D view. Finally, panel f shows the IMF (magnitude), the density, and the velocity of the solar wind temporal variation. The arrival and ending times of the CME
transits at BepiColombo are indicated with vertical dashed
lines in panel f. According to the simulation, the CME arrived at BepiColombo and Venus on 13 October 2020 at
about noon (UT time). Since the velocity was relatively low,
it needed a couple of days to transit Venus. The simulation
predicts that the CME left Venus on 15 October 2020 at about
15:00 UT. Therefore, the BepiColombo flyby most probably
occurred while the CME was still transiting Venus. The sec
https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-811-2021

ond CME most probably also hit Venus after the flyby arriving on 17 October 2020 as predicted by the simulation.
Figure 13 shows the actual solar wind observations made
by BepiColombo from 12 to 17 October. In particular, it
shows the IMF measured by the MPO-MAG in panel (a),
the proxy for galactic cosmic ray flux measured by BERM in
panel (b), and the solar wind energetic electron spectra from
MEAT in panel (c). The reason for the large data gaps in
panel (c) is that MEA1 only operated for a few hours around
the closest approach. This figure shows that the solar wind
was indeed clearly disturbed. The overall magnitude of the
solar wind is ~ 15 nT for most of the period, similarly to the
induced magnetic field values observed at Venus (yellowish
box). The CME arrived at BepiColombo on 13 October at
04:20 UT (vertical purple dashed line), where a moderate rise
in the IMF magnitude from 10 to 15 nT was observed simul

taneously with a rotation in the three components of the field,
mainly seen in B,. Moreover, starting a few hours before, a
significant reduction in the GCR flux was observed (purple
dashed line in panel b), and the GCR flux remained low for
almost 2d. These kinds of reductions followed by a gradual
recovery could be associated with Forbush decreases, which
are produced by the magnetic flux rope inside the CME that
scatters away the incoming GCR (Witasse et al., 2017). In
this sense, Forbush decreases are good indicators of CME arrivals. The IMF magnitude was maintained at ~ 15 nT and
the level of GCR was kept relatively constant until a few
hours before the encounter with Venus. MEA1 observations
also agree with the idea of a CME transiting as the variability observed in the solar wind energetic electron observations matches very well with the magnetic variability, especially when the B, and B, components are negative. This
corroborates the idea that the solar wind was disturbed just

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021

a few hours before BepiColombo’s Venus encounter. These
small and slow CMEs are transients often seen during low
solar activity phases of the solar cycle and are often called
stealth CMEs because, as in this case, no clear source is identified. BepiColombo has already encountered several transient structures of this type, such as that presented in Heyner
et al. (2021). Although stealth CMEs typically are pushed
by the solar wind, they have the capacity to interact with the
planet’s conductive surface and ionosphere plasma: this is especially the case for unmagnetized planets, as demonstrated
in this study at Venus and also with similar events at Mars by
Sanchez-Cano et al. (2017) and Kajdic¢ et al. (2021). In addition, we also note that during the closest approach (starting
and ending right before and after Venus inbound and outbound, respectively), BERM detected a moderate reduction
of 12% in the GCR flux proxy. The reason for this reduction is unknown and could be a consequence of a solid-angle

effect from Venus, similarly to those observed at Mars at an
orbiter periapsis (e.g. Semkova et al., 2018). For this reason,
panel (b) shows the part of BepiColombo’s solid angle not
shadowed by Venus in orange, where | stands for null shadowed (null solid angle). The solid angle has been calculated
as w = 27(1 —cos@), where @ is the linear angle between
BepiColombo’s distance to the centre of the planet and BepiColombo’s distance to the limb of the planet, which in turn is
calculated as the arcsine of the ratio between Venus’s radius
and BepiColombo’s distance to the centre of the planet. The
part of space not shadowed by the solid angle (orange line) is
calculated as 1 — (w/4zr). We note that the BERM flux-level
reduction that can be attributed to the solid-angle effect is
much shorter than the actual nearly constant reduction found.
Nevertheless, other effects more difficult to discern may also
be playing a role, such as shadowing from one’s own spacecraft due to attitude changes. Interestingly, Rosetta also saw
a similar reduction in the GCR flux of 8 % in the vicinity of
the comet 67P/Churyumov—Gerasimenko which could not be
attributed to any known mechanisms (Honig et al., 2019).
Right after the flyby, there was still significant solar wind
variability and, according to the simulation in Fig. 12, these

https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-811-2021

perturbations are most probably caused by the trailing edge
of the CME. This means that during the flyby to Venus, the
system was most probably immersed in the CME. The MEA1
observations also corroborate this finding, showing a large
perturbation in the solar wind electrons on 15 October at
22:00 UT at the same time that a large variability is observed
in the MPO-MAG data with B, and B, IMF rotations.

5.2 Venus Express solar wind conditions

Interestingly, Kajdi¢é et al. (2021) noticed that in November 2007 there was a good alignment of Mercury, Venus,
Earth, and Mars. In the period of 20 to 27 November, during
the presented VEX event, a CME and two stream interaction regions (SIRs) were observed by ACE, STEREO A and
B, and Mars Express. With the aforementioned alignment of
the planets it stands to reason that Venus’s induced magnetosphere was also impacted by these structures.

This means that the solar wind conditions during the VEX
event, shown in Fig. 10, are very comparable with those during the BepiColombo flyby. Even though VEX traversed the
tail much closer to the planet, the disturbance of the magneto

motion, driven from outside in (Rong et al., 2015).

6 Conclusions

The first Venus encounter by BepiColombo has shown a new
view of the Venusian-induced magnetosphere up to about 48
Venus radii downstream. Until this flyby only one spacecraft
had ever ventured this far down the magnetotail, Mariner 10
(Lepping and Behannon, 1978). A few months later, in December 2020, Solar Orbiter also had its Venus flyby over a
similar distance along the tail investigating its dynamics (see
e.g. Fig. 14 and Volwerk et al., 2021).

The asymmetric draping of the magnetic field, just behind
the bow shock in the magnetosheath, as observed by Delva
et al. (2017) and modelled by Jarvinen et al. (2013), was confirmed by this flyby. The field pointed in the direction perpendicular to the Venus—Sun line before the spacecraft entered
the magnetotail proper.

The magnetotail was very active, with strong oscillations
of the magnetic field with AB/B ~ 0.6, with a period of
~ 7 min. This oscillation or flapping of the magnetotail was
slower than what was typically measured by VEX in 2007,
where Rong et al. (2015) determined a period of ~ 3 min.
However, observations in the Earth’s magnetotail show that
the magnetotail flapping period varies from ~ 3 min (Sergeev
et al., 2003) to ~ 20 min (Zhang et al., 2005).

Ann. Geophys., 39, 811-831, 2021

Orbiter. The Venus 2 flybys will take place on 9 August 2021 for Solar

During the strong oscillations of the magnetic field
SERENA-PICAM measured increased ion fluxes when the
total field was at a minimum. At the same time MEA showed
that there were two populations of electrons, one below
10 eV and one between 32 and 100 eV. The latter “hot” population was also observed by Venus Express much closer to
the planet.

Despite the low solar activity conditions, the flyby was affected by the impact of a stealth coronal mass ejection that
was travelling at approximately the same speed as the background solar wind and impacted Venus and BepiColombo
about 2 d before the closest approach on 13 October. Due to
the low speed of this CME, in situ magnetic and particle observations together with a solar wind simulation indicate that
the trailing part of the CME was still affecting Venus at the
time of BepiColombo’s closest approach and tail transit. A
second CME may have hit both Venus and BepiColombo on
17 October, in principle, not affecting the flyby. Therefore,
the highly dynamic tail observed by BepiColombo may be
the consequence of space weather activity.

On 10 August 2021, the second Venus flyby will take
place, where BepiColombo will approach the planet from
the tail side and pass closely by the planet in the dayside
magnetosphere, as shown in Fig. 14 bottom panel. One day
earlier, on 9 August, Solar Orbiter will also have its second
Venus flyby in a more similar orbit than the first flyby. This
means that both spacecraft can act as solar wind monitors
